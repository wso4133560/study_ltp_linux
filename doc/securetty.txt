           securetty - list of terminals on which root is allowed to login
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The file _/etc/securetty_ contains the names of terminals (one per
           line, without leading _/dev/_ ) which are considered secure for the
           transmission of certain authentication tokens.
    
           It is used by (some versions of) login(1) to restrict the
           terminals on which root is allowed to login.  See login.defs(5)
           if you use the shadow suite.
    
           On PAM enabled systems, it is used for the same purpose by
           pam_securetty(8) to restrict the terminals on which empty
           passwords are accepted.

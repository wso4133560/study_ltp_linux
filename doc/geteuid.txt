    GETUID(2)               Linux Programmer's Manual              GETUID(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           getuid, geteuid - get user identity
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           uid_t getuid(void);
           uid_t geteuid(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           getuid () returns the real user ID of the calling process.
    
           geteuid () returns the effective user ID of the calling process.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           These functions are always successful and never modify _errno_.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.

       History
           In UNIX V6 the getuid () call returned _(euid << 8) + uid_.  UNIX V7
           introduced separate calls getuid () and geteuid ().
    
           The original Linux getuid () and geteuid () system calls supported
           only 16-bit user IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added getuid32 ()
           and geteuid32 (), supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc getuid () and
           geteuid () wrapper functions transparently deal with the
           variations across kernel versions.
    
           On Alpha, instead of a pair of getuid () and geteuid () system
           calls, a single getxuid () system call is provided, which returns
           a pair of real and effective UIDs.  The glibc getuid () and
           geteuid () wrapper functions transparently deal with this.  See
           syscall(2) for details regarding register mapping.

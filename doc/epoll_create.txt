    EPOLL_CREATE(2)         Linux Programmer's Manual        EPOLL_CREATE(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           epoll_create, epoll_create1 - open an epoll file descriptor
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/epoll.h>
    
           int epoll_create(int _size_ );
           int epoll_create1(int _flags_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           epoll_create () creates a new epoll(7) instance.  Since Linux
           2.6.8, the _size_ argument is ignored, but must be greater than
           zero; see NOTES.
    
           epoll_create () returns a file descriptor referring to the new
           epoll instance.  This file descriptor is used for all the
           subsequent calls to the epoll interface.  When no longer
           required, the file descriptor returned by epoll_create () should
           be closed by using close(2).  When all file descriptors referring
           to an epoll instance have been closed, the kernel destroys the
           instance and releases the associated resources for reuse.
    
       epoll_create1()
           If _flags_ is 0, then, other than the fact that the obsolete _size_
           argument is dropped, epoll_create1 () is the same as
           epoll_create ().  The following value can be included in _flags_ to
           obtain different behavior:
    
           EPOLL_CLOEXEC
                  Set the close-on-exec ( FD_CLOEXEC ) flag on the new file
                  descriptor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in
                  open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, these system calls return a file descriptor (a
           nonnegative integer).  On error, -1 is returned, and _errno_ is set
           to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL _size_ is not positive.
    
           EINVAL ( epoll_create1 ()) Invalid value specified in _flags_.
    
           EMFILE The per-user limit on the number of epoll instances
                  imposed by _/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_instances_ was
                  encountered.  See epoll(7) for further details.
    
           EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file
                  descriptors has been reached.
    
           ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
                  has been reached.
    
           ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create the kernel object.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           epoll_create () was added to the kernel in version 2.6.  Library
           support is provided in glibc starting with version 2.3.2.
    
           epoll_create1 () was added to the kernel in version 2.6.27.
           Library support is provided in glibc starting with version 2.9.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           epoll_create () and epoll_create1 () are Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           In the initial epoll_create () implementation, the _size_ argument
           informed the kernel of the number of file descriptors that the
           caller expected to add to the epoll instance.  The kernel used
           this information as a hint for the amount of space to initially
           allocate in internal data structures describing events.  (If
           necessary, the kernel would allocate more space if the caller's
           usage exceeded the hint given in _size_.)  Nowadays, this hint is
           no longer required (the kernel dynamically sizes the required
           data structures without needing the hint), but _size_ must still be
           greater than zero, in order to ensure backward compatibility when
           new epoll applications are run on older kernels.

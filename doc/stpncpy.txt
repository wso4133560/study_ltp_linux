## NAME         top
    
    
           stpncpy - copy a fixed-size string, returning a pointer to its
           end
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <string.h>
    
           char stpncpy(char restrict _dest_ , const char restrict _src_ , size_t _n_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           stpncpy ():
               Since glibc 2.10:
                   _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
               Before glibc 2.10:
                   _GNU_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The stpncpy () function copies at most _n_ characters from the
           string pointed to by _src_ , including the terminating null byte
           ('\0'), to the array pointed to by _dest_.  Exactly _n_ characters
           are written at _dest_.  If the length _strlen(src)_ is smaller than
           _n_ , the remaining characters in the array pointed to by _dest_ are
           filled with null bytes ('\0'), If the length _strlen(src)_ is
           greater than or equal to _n_ , the string pointed to by _dest_ will
           not be null-terminated.
    
           The strings may not overlap.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _n_
           characters at _dest_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           stpncpy () returns a pointer to the terminating null byte in _dest_ ,
           or, if _dest_ is not null-terminated, _dest_ + _n_.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This function was added to POSIX.1-2008.  Before that, it was a
           GNU extension.  It first appeared in version 1.07 of the GNU C
           library in 1993.

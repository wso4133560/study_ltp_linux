    SYSINFO(2)              Linux Programmer's Manual             SYSINFO(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           sysinfo - return system information
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/sysinfo.h>
    
           int sysinfo(struct sysinfo  _info_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           sysinfo () returns certain statistics on memory and swap usage, as
           well as the load average.
    
           Until Linux 2.3.16, sysinfo () returned information in the
           following structure:
    
               struct sysinfo {
                   long uptime;             / Seconds since boot /
                   unsigned long loads[3];  / 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages /
                   unsigned long totalram;  / Total usable main memory size /
                   unsigned long freeram;   / Available memory size /
                   unsigned long sharedram; / Amount of shared memory /
                   unsigned long bufferram; / Memory used by buffers /
                   unsigned long totalswap; / Total swap space size /
                   unsigned long freeswap;  / Swap space still available /
                   unsigned short procs;    / Number of current processes /
                   char _f[22];             / Pads structure to 64 bytes /
               };
    
           In the above structure, the sizes of the memory and swap fields
           are given in bytes.
    
           Since Linux 2.3.23 (i386) and Linux 2.3.48 (all architectures)
           the structure is:
    
               struct sysinfo {
                   long uptime;             / Seconds since boot /
                   unsigned long loads[3];  / 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages /
                   unsigned long totalram;  / Total usable main memory size /
                   unsigned long freeram;   / Available memory size /
                   unsigned long sharedram; / Amount of shared memory /
                   unsigned long bufferram; / Memory used by buffers /
                   unsigned long totalswap; / Total swap space size /
                   unsigned long freeswap;  / Swap space still available /
                   unsigned short procs;    / Number of current processes /
                   unsigned long totalhigh; / Total high memory size /
                   unsigned long freehigh;  / Available high memory size /
                   unsigned int mem_unit;   / Memory unit size in bytes /
                   char _f[20-2sizeof(long)-sizeof(int)];
                                            / Padding to 64 bytes /
               };
    
           In the above structure, sizes of the memory and swap fields are
           given as multiples of _mem_unit_ bytes.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, sysinfo () returns zero.  On error, -1 is returned,
           and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT _info_ is not a valid address.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           sysinfo () first appeared in Linux 0.98.pl6.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This function is Linux-specific, and should not be used in
           programs intended to be portable.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           All of the information provided by this system call is also
           available via _/proc/meminfo_ and _/proc/loadavg_.

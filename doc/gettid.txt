    GETTID(2)               Linux Programmer's Manual              GETTID(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           gettid - get thread identification
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #define _GNU_SOURCE
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           pid_t gettid(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           gettid () returns the caller's thread ID (TID).  In a single-
           threaded process, the thread ID is equal to the process ID (PID,
           as returned by getpid(2)).  In a multithreaded process, all
           threads have the same PID, but each one has a unique TID.  For
           further details, see the discussion of CLONE_THREAD in clone(2).
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, returns the thread ID of the calling thread.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           This call is always successful.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The gettid () system call first appeared on Linux in kernel
           2.4.11.  Library support was added in glibc 2.30.  (Earlier glibc
           versions did not provide a wrapper for this system call,
           necessitating the use of syscall(2).)
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           gettid () is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs
           that are intended to be portable.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The thread ID returned by this call is not the same thing as a
           POSIX thread ID (i.e., the opaque value returned by
           pthread_self(3)).
    
           In a new thread group created by a clone(2) call that does not
           specify the CLONE_THREAD flag (or, equivalently, a new process
           created by fork(2)), the new process is a thread group leader,
           and its thread group ID (the value returned by getpid(2)) is the
           same as its thread ID (the value returned by gettid ()).

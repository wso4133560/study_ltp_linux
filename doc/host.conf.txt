## NAME         top
    
    
           host.conf - resolver configuration file
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The file _/etc/host.conf_ contains configuration information
           specific to the resolver library.  It should contain one
           configuration keyword per line, followed by appropriate
           configuration information.  The following keywords are
           recognized:
    
           _trim_   This keyword may be listed more than once.  Each time it
                  should be followed by a list of domains, separated by
                  colons (':'), semicolons (';') or commas (','), with the
                  leading dot.  When set, the resolver library will
                  automatically trim the given domain name from the end of
                  any hostname resolved via DNS.  This is intended for use
                  with local hosts and domains.  (Related note: _trim_ will
                  not affect hostnames gathered via NIS or the hosts(5)
                  file.  Care should be taken to ensure that the first
                  hostname for each entry in the hosts file is fully
                  qualified or unqualified, as appropriate for the local
                  installation.)
    
           _multi_  Valid values are _on_ and _off_.  If set to _on_ , the resolver
                  library will return all valid addresses for a host that
                  appears in the _/etc/hosts_ file, instead of only the first.
                  This is _off_ by default, as it may cause a substantial
                  performance loss at sites with large hosts files.
    
           _reorder_
                  Valid values are _on_ and _off_.  If set to _on_ , the resolver
                  library will attempt to reorder host addresses so that
                  local addresses (i.e., on the same subnet) are listed
                  first when a gethostbyname(3) is performed.  Reordering is
                  done for all lookup methods.  The default value is _off_.
    
## ENVIRONMENT         top
    
    
           The following environment variables can be used to allow users to
           override the behavior which is configured in _/etc/host.conf_ :
    
           RESOLV_HOST_CONF
                  If set, this variable points to a file that should be read
                  instead of _/etc/host.conf_.
    
           RESOLV_MULTI
                  Overrides the _multi_ command.
    
           RESOLV_REORDER
                  Overrides the _reorder_ command.
    
           RESOLV_ADD_TRIM_DOMAINS
                  A list of domains,  separated by colons (':'), semicolons
                  (';'), or commas (','), with the leading dot, which will
                  be added to the list of domains that should be trimmed.
    
           RESOLV_OVERRIDE_TRIM_DOMAINS
                  A list of domains,  separated by colons (':'), semicolons
                  (';'), or commas (','), with the leading dot, which will
                  replace the list of domains that should be trimmed.
                  Overrides the _trim_ command.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           The following differences exist compared to the original
           implementation.  A new command _spoof_ and a new environment
           variable RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK can take arguments like _off_ , _nowarn_ ,
           and _warn_.  Line comments can appear anywhere and not only at the
           beginning of a line.
    
       Historical
           The nsswitch.conf(5) file is the modern way of controlling the
           order of host lookups.
    
           In glibc 2.4 and earlier, the following keyword is recognized:
    
           _order_  This keyword specifies how host lookups are to be
                  performed.  It should be followed by one or more lookup
                  methods, separated by commas.  Valid methods are _bind_ ,
                  _hosts_ , and _nis_.
    
           RESOLV_SERV_ORDER
                  Overrides the _order_ command.
    
           Since glibc 2.0.7, and up through glibc 2.24, the following
           keywords and environment variable have been recognized but never
           implemented:
    
           _nospoof_
                  Valid values are _on_ and _off_.  If set to _on_ , the resolver
                  library will attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to
                  enhance the security of rlogin and rsh.  It works as
                  follows: after performing a host address lookup, the
                  resolver library will perform a hostname lookup for that
                  address.  If the two hostnames do not match, the query
                  fails.  The default value is _off_.
    
           _spoofalert_
                  Valid values are _on_ and _off_.  If this option is set to _on_
                  and the _nospoof_ option is also set, the resolver library
                  will log a warning of the error via the syslog facility.
                  The default value is _off_.
    
           _spoof_  Valid values are _off_ , _nowarn_ , and _warn_.  If this option is
                  set to _off_ , spoofed addresses are permitted and no
                  warnings will be emitted via the syslog facility.  If this
                  option is set to _warn_ , the resolver library will attempt
                  to prevent hostname spoofing to enhance the security and
                  log a warning of the error via the syslog facility.  If
                  this option is set to _nowarn_ , the resolver library will
                  attempt to prevent hostname spoofing to enhance the
                  security but not emit warnings via the syslog facility.
                  Setting this option to anything else is equal to setting
                  it to _nowarn_.
    
           RESOLV_SPOOF_CHECK
                  Overrides the _nospoof_ , _spoofalert_ , and _spoof_ commands in
                  the same way as the _spoof_ command is parsed.  Valid values
                  are _off_ , _nowarn_ , and _warn_.

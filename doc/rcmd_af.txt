## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The rcmd () function is used by the superuser to execute a command
           on a remote machine using an authentication scheme based on
           privileged port numbers.  The rresvport () function returns a file
           descriptor to a socket with an address in the privileged port
           space.  The iruserok () and ruserok () functions are used by
           servers to authenticate clients requesting service with rcmd ().
           All four functions are used by the rshd (8) server (among others).
    
       rcmd()
           The rcmd () function looks up the host _ahost_ using
           gethostbyname(3), returning -1 if the host does not exist.
           Otherwise, _ahost_ is set to the standard name of the host and a
           connection is established to a server residing at the well-known
           Internet port _inport_.
    
           If the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet domain of
           type SOCK_STREAM is returned to the caller, and given to the
           remote command as _stdin_ and _stdout_.  If _fd2p_ is nonzero, then an
           auxiliary channel to a control process will be set up, and a file
           descriptor for it will be placed in _fd2p_.  The control process
           will return diagnostic output from the command (unit 2) on this
           channel, and will also accept bytes on this channel as being UNIX
           signal numbers, to be forwarded to the process group of the
           command.  If _fd2p_ is 0, then the _stderr_ (unit 2 of the remote
           command) will be made the same as the _stdout_ and no provision is
           made for sending arbitrary signals to the remote process,
           although you may be able to get its attention by using out-of-
           band data.
    
           The protocol is described in detail in rshd (8).
    
       rresvport()
           The rresvport () function is used to obtain a socket with a
           privileged port bound to it.  This socket is suitable for use by
           rcmd () and several other functions.  Privileged ports are those
           in the range 0 to 1023.  Only a privileged process (on Linux, a
           process that has the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability in the user
           namespace governing its network namespace) is allowed to bind to
           a privileged port.  In the glibc implementation, this function
           restricts its search to the ports from 512 to 1023.  The _port_
           argument is value-result: the value it supplies to the call is
           used as the starting point for a circular search of the port
           range; on (successful) return, it contains the port number that
           was bound to.
    
       iruserok() and ruserok()
           The iruserok () and ruserok () functions take a remote host's IP
           address or name, respectively, two usernames and a flag
           indicating whether the local user's name is that of the
           superuser.  Then, if the user is _not_ the superuser, it checks the
           _/etc/hosts.equiv_ file.  If that lookup is not done, or is
           unsuccessful, the _.rhosts_ in the local user's home directory is
           checked to see if the request for service is allowed.
    
           If this file does not exist, is not a regular file, is owned by
           anyone other than the user or the superuser, is writable by
           anyone other than the owner, or is hardlinked anywhere, the check
           automatically fails.  Zero is returned if the machine name is
           listed in the _hosts.equiv_ file, or the host and remote username
           are found in the _.rhosts_ file; otherwise iruserok () and ruserok ()
           return -1.  If the local domain (as obtained from gethostname(2))
           is the same as the remote domain, only the machine name need be
           specified.
    
           If the IP address of the remote host is known, iruserok () should
           be used in preference to ruserok (), as it does not require
           trusting the DNS server for the remote host's domain.
    
       _af() variants
           All of the functions described above work with IPv4 ( AF_INET )
           sockets.  The "_af" variants take an extra argument that allows
           the socket address family to be specified.  For these functions,
           the _af_ argument can be specified as AF_INET or AF_INET6.  In
           addition, rcmd_af () supports the use of AF_UNSPEC.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The rcmd () function returns a valid socket descriptor on success.
           It returns -1 on error and prints a diagnostic message on the
           standard error.
    
           The rresvport () function returns a valid, bound socket descriptor
           on success.  On failure, it returns -1 and sets _errno_ to indicate
           the error.  The error code EAGAIN is overloaded to mean: "All
           network ports in use".
    
           For information on the return from ruserok () and iruserok (), see
           above.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The functions iruserok_af (), rcmd_af (), rresvport_af (), and
           ruserok_af () functions are provide in glibc since version 2.2.

           Not in POSIX.1.  Present on the BSDs, Solaris, and many other
           systems.  These functions appeared in 4.2BSD.  The "_af" variants
           are more recent additions, and are not present on as wide a range
           of systems.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           iruserok () and iruserok_af () are declared in glibc headers only
           since version 2.12.

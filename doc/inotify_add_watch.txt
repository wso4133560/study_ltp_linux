## NAME         top
    
    
           inotify_add_watch - add a watch to an initialized inotify
           instance
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/inotify.h>
    
           int inotify_add_watch(int _fd_ , const char  _pathname_ , uint32_t _mask_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           inotify_add_watch () adds a new watch, or modifies an existing
           watch, for the file whose location is specified in _pathname_ ; the
           caller must have read permission for this file.  The _fd_ argument
           is a file descriptor referring to the inotify instance whose
           watch list is to be modified.  The events to be monitored for
           _pathname_ are specified in the _mask_ bit-mask argument.  See
           inotify(7) for a description of the bits that can be set in _mask_.
    
           A successful call to inotify_add_watch () returns a unique watch
           descriptor for this inotify instance, for the filesystem object
           (inode) that corresponds to _pathname_.  If the filesystem object
           was not previously being watched by this inotify instance, then
           the watch descriptor is newly allocated.  If the filesystem
           object was already being watched (perhaps via a different link to
           the same object), then the descriptor for the existing watch is
           returned.
    
           The watch descriptor is returned by later read(2)s from the
           inotify file descriptor.  These reads fetch _inotify_event_
           structures (see inotify(7)) indicating filesystem events; the
           watch descriptor inside this structure identifies the object for
           which the event occurred.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, inotify_add_watch () returns a watch descriptor (a
           nonnegative integer).  On error, -1 is returned and _errno_ is set
           to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EACCES Read access to the given file is not permitted.
    
           EBADF The given file descriptor is not valid.
    
           EEXIST _mask_ contains IN_MASK_CREATE and _pathname_ refers to a file
                  already being watched by the same _fd_.
    
           EFAULT _pathname_ points outside of the process's accessible
                  address space.
    
           EINVAL The given event mask contains no valid events; or _mask_
                  contains both IN_MASK_ADD and IN_MASK_CREATE ; or _fd_ is not
                  an inotify file descriptor.
    
           ENAMETOOLONG
                  _pathname_ is too long.
    
           ENOENT A directory component in _pathname_ does not exist or is a
                  dangling symbolic link.
    
           ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.
    
           ENOSPC The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was
                  reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed
                  resource.
    
           ENOTDIR
                  _mask_ contains IN_ONLYDIR and _pathname_ is not a directory.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           Inotify was merged into the 2.6.13 Linux kernel.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This system call is Linux-specific.

    CHDIR(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               CHDIR(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           chdir, fchdir - change working directory
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int chdir(const char  _path_ );
           int fchdir(int _fd_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           fchdir ():
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
                   || / Since glibc 2.12: / _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
                   || / Glibc up to and including 2.19: / _BSD_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           chdir () changes the current working directory of the calling
           process to the directory specified in _path_.
    
           fchdir () is identical to chdir (); the only difference is that the
           directory is given as an open file descriptor.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           Depending on the filesystem, other errors can be returned.  The
           more general errors for chdir () are listed below:
    
           EACCES Search permission is denied for one of the components of
                  _path_.  (See also path_resolution(7).)
    
           EFAULT _path_ points outside your accessible address space.
    
           EIO An I/O error occurred.
    
           ELOOP Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
                  _path_.
    
           ENAMETOOLONG
                  _path_ is too long.
    
           ENOENT The directory specified in _path_ does not exist.
    
           ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.
    
           ENOTDIR
                  A component of _path_ is not a directory.
    
           The general errors for fchdir () are listed below:
    
           EACCES Search permission was denied on the directory open on _fd_.
    
           EBADF _fd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           ENOTDIR
                  _fd_ does not refer to a directory.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top

## NOTES         top
    
    
           The current working directory is the starting point for
           interpreting relative pathnames (those not starting with '/').
    
           A child process created via fork(2) inherits its parent's current
           working directory.  The current working directory is left
           unchanged by execve(2).

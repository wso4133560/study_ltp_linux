## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           _program_invocation_name_ contains the name that was used to invoke
           the calling program.  This is the same as the value of _argv[0]_ in
           _main_ (), with the difference that the scope of
           _program_invocation_name_ is global.
    
           _program_invocation_short_name_ contains the basename component of
           name that was used to invoke the calling program.  That is, it is
           the same value as _program_invocation_name_ , with all text up to
           and including the final slash (/), if any, removed.
    
           These variables are automatically initialized by the glibc run-
           time startup code.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These variables are GNU extensions, and should not be used in
           programs intended to be portable.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The Linux-specific _/proc/[number]/cmdline_ file provides access to
           similar information.

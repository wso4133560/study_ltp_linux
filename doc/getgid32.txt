    GETGID(2)               Linux Programmer's Manual              GETGID(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           getgid, getegid - get group identity
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           gid_t getgid(void);
           gid_t getegid(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           getgid () returns the real group ID of the calling process.
    
           getegid () returns the effective group ID of the calling process.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           These functions are always successful and never modify _errno_.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The original Linux getgid () and getegid () system calls supported
           only 16-bit group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added getgid32 ()
           and getegid32 (), supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc getgid () and
           getegid () wrapper functions transparently deal with the
           variations across kernel versions.
    
           On Alpha, instead of a pair of getgid () and getegid () system
           calls, a single getxgid () system call is provided, which returns
           a pair of real and effective GIDs.  The glibc getgid () and
           getegid () wrapper functions transparently deal with this.  See
           syscall(2) for details regarding register mapping.

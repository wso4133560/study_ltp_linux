    BINDRESVPORT(3)         Linux Programmer's Manual        BINDRESVPORT(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           bindresvport - bind a socket to a privileged IP port
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <netinet/in.h>
    
           int bindresvport(int _sockfd_ , struct sockaddr_in  _sin_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           bindresvport () is used to bind the socket referred to by the file
           descriptor _sockfd_ to a privileged anonymous IP port, that is, a
           port number arbitrarily selected from the range 512 to 1023.
    
           If the bind(2) performed by bindresvport () is successful, and _sin_
           is not NULL, then _sin- >sin_port_ returns the port number actually
           allocated.
    
           _sin_ can be NULL, in which case _sin- >sin_family_ is implicitly
           taken to be AF_INET.  However, in this case, bindresvport () has
           no way to return the port number actually allocated.  (This
           information can later be obtained using getsockname(2).)
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           bindresvport () returns 0 on success; otherwise -1 is returned and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           bindresvport () can fail for any of the same reasons as bind(2).
           In addition, the following errors may occur:
    
           EACCES The calling process was not privileged (on Linux: the
                  calling process did not have the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
                  capability in the user namespace governing its network
                  namespace).
    
           EADDRINUSE
                  All privileged ports are in use.
    
           EAFNOSUPPORT ( EPFNOSUPPORT in glibc 2.7 and earlier)
                  _sin_ is not NULL and _sin- >sin_family_ is not AF_INET.

           The bindresvport () function uses a static variable that was not
           protected by a lock before glibc 2.17, rendering the function MT-
           Unsafe.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           Not in POSIX.1.  Present on the BSDs, Solaris, and many other
           systems.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Unlike some bindresvport () implementations, the glibc
           implementation ignores any value that the caller supplies in
           _sin- >sin_port_.

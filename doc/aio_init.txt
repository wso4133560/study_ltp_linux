## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The GNU-specific aio_init () function allows the caller to provide
           tuning hints to the glibc POSIX AIO implementation.  Use of this
           function is optional, but to be effective, it must be called
           before employing any other functions in the POSIX AIO API.
    
           The tuning information is provided in the buffer pointed to by
           the argument _init_.  This buffer is a structure of the following
           form:
    
               struct aioinit {
                   int aio_threads;    / Maximum number of threads /
                   int aio_num;        / Number of expected simultaneous
                                          requests /
                   int aio_locks;      / Not used /
                   int aio_usedba;     / Not used /
                   int aio_debug;      / Not used /
                   int aio_numusers;   / Not used /
                   int aio_idle_time;  / Number of seconds before idle thread
                                          terminates (since glibc 2.2) /
                   int aio_reserved;
               };
    
           The following fields are used in the _aioinit_ structure:
    
           _aio_threads_
                  This field specifies the maximum number of worker threads
                  that may be used by the implementation.  If the number of
                  outstanding I/O operations exceeds this limit, then excess
                  operations will be queued until a worker thread becomes
                  free.  If this field is specified with a value less than
                  1, the value 1 is used.  The default value is 20.
    
           _aio_num_
                  This field should specify the maximum number of
                  simultaneous I/O requests that the caller expects to
                  enqueue.  If a value less than 32 is specified for this
                  field, it is rounded up to 32.  The default value is 64.
    
           _aio_idle_time_
                  This field specifies the amount of time in seconds that a
                  worker thread should wait for further requests before
                  terminating, after having completed a previous request.
                  The default value is 1.

    USTAT(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               USTAT(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           ustat - get filesystem statistics
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <unistd.h>    / libc[45] /
           #include <ustat.h>     / glibc2 /
    
           int ustat(dev_t _dev_ , struct ustat  _ubuf_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           ustat () returns information about a mounted filesystem.  _dev_ is a
           device number identifying a device containing a mounted
           filesystem.  _ubuf_ is a pointer to a _ustat_ structure that contains
           the following members:
    
               daddr_t f_tfree;      / Total free blocks /
               ino_t   f_tinode;     / Number of free inodes /
               char    f_fname[6];   / Filsys name /
               char    f_fpack[6];   / Filsys pack name /
    
           The last two fields, _f_fname_ and _f_fpack_ , are not implemented and
           will always be filled with null bytes ('\0').
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned and the _ustat_ structure pointed to
           by _ubuf_ will be filled in.  On error, -1 is returned, and _errno_
           is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT _ubuf_ points outside of your accessible address space.
    
           EINVAL _dev_ does not refer to a device containing a mounted
                  filesystem.
    
           ENOSYS The mounted filesystem referenced by _dev_ does not support
                  this operation, or any version of Linux before 1.3.16.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           Since version 2.28, glibc no longer provides a wrapper for this
           system call.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           SVr4.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           ustat () is deprecated and has been provided only for
           compatibility.  All new programs should use statfs(2) instead.
    
       HP-UX notes
           The HP-UX version of the _ustat_ structure has an additional field,
           _f_blksize_ , that is unknown elsewhere.  HP-UX warns: For some
           filesystems, the number of free inodes does not change.  Such
           filesystems will return -1 in the field _f_tinode_.  For some
           filesystems, inodes are dynamically allocated.  Such filesystems
           will return the current number of free inodes.

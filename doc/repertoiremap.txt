## NAME         top
    
    
           repertoiremap - map symbolic character names to Unicode code
           points
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           A repertoire map defines mappings between symbolic character
           names (mnemonics) and Unicode code points when compiling a locale
           with localedef(1).  Using a repertoire map is optional, it is
           needed only when symbolic names are used instead of now preferred
           Unicode code points.
    
       Syntax
           The repertoiremap file starts with a header that may consist of
           the following keywords:
    
           _comment_char_
                  is followed by a character that will be used as the
                  comment character for the rest of the file.  It defaults
                  to the number sign (#).
    
           _escape_char_
                  is followed by a character that should be used as the
                  escape character for the rest of the file to mark
                  characters that should be interpreted in a special way.
                  It defaults to the backslash (\).
    
           The mapping section starts with the keyword _CHARIDS_ in the first
           column.
    
           The mapping lines have the following form:
    
           _< symbolic-name> <code-point> comment_
                  This defines exactly one mapping, _comment_ being optional.
    
           The mapping section ends with the string _END CHARIDS_.

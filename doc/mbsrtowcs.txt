## NAME         top
    
    
           mbsrtowcs - convert a multibyte string to a wide-character string
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           size_t mbsrtowcs(wchar_t restrict _dest_ , const char restrict _src_ ,
                            size_t _len_ , mbstate_t restrict _ps_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           If _dest_ is not NULL, the mbsrtowcs () function converts the
           multibyte string _src_ to a wide-character string starting at
           _dest_.  At most _len_ wide characters are written to _dest_.  The
           shift state _ps_ is updated.  The conversion is effectively
           performed by repeatedly calling _mbrtowc(dest, src, n, ps)_ where
           _n_ is some positive number, as long as this call succeeds, and
           then incrementing _dest_ by one and _src_ by the number of bytes
           consumed.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:
    
           1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.  In this
              case, _src_ is left pointing to the invalid multibyte sequence,
              _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and _errno_ is set to EILSEQ.
    
           2. _len_ non-L'\0' wide characters have been stored at _dest_.  In
              this case, _src_ is left pointing to the next multibyte
              sequence to be converted, and the number of wide characters
              written to _dest_ is returned.
    
           3. The multibyte string has been completely converted, including
              the terminating null wide character ('\0'), which has the side
              effect of bringing back _ps_ to the initial state.  In this
              case, _src_ is set to NULL, and the number of wide characters
              written to _dest_ , excluding the terminating null wide
              character, is returned.
    
           If _dest_ is NULL, _len_ is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as
           above, except that the converted wide characters are not written
           out to memory, and that no length limit exists.
    
           In both of the above cases, if _ps_ is NULL, a static anonymous
           state known only to the mbsrtowcs () function is used instead.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _len_
           wide characters at _dest_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The mbsrtowcs () function returns the number of wide characters
           that make up the converted part of the wide-character string, not
           including the terminating null wide character.  If an invalid
           multibyte sequence was encountered, _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and
           _errno_ set to EILSEQ.

           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of mbsrtowcs () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.
    
           Passing NULL as _ps_ is not multithread safe.

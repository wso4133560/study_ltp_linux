## NAME         top
    
    
           iswgraph - test for graphic wide character
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wctype.h>
    
           int iswgraph(wint_t _wc_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The iswgraph () function is the wide-character equivalent of the
           isgraph(3) function.  It tests whether _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "graph".
    
           The wide-character class "graph" is a subclass of the wide-
           character class "print".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
           character class "graph" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "cntrl".
    
           The wide-character class "graph" is disjoint from the wide-
           character class "space" and therefore also disjoint from its
           subclass "blank".
    
           The wide-character class "graph" contains all the wide characters
           from the wide-character class "print" except the space character.
           It therefore contains the wide-character classes "alnum" and
           "punct".
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The iswgraph () function returns nonzero if _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "graph".  Otherwise, it
           returns zero.

           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of iswgraph () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.

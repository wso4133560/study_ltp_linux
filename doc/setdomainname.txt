## NAME         top
    
    
           getdomainname, setdomainname - get/set NIS domain name
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int getdomainname(char  _name_ , size_t _len_ );
           int setdomainname(const char  _name_ , size_t _len_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           getdomainname (), setdomainname ():
               Since glibc 2.21:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               In glibc 2.19 and 2.20:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
               Up to and including glibc 2.19:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These functions are used to access or to change the NIS domain
           name of the host system.  More precisely, they operate on the NIS
           domain name associated with the calling process's UTS namespace.
    
           setdomainname () sets the domain name to the value given in the
           character array _name_.  The _len_ argument specifies the number of
           bytes in _name_.  (Thus, _name_ does not require a terminating null
           byte.)
    
           getdomainname () returns the null-terminated domain name in the
           character array _name_ , which has a length of _len_ bytes.  If the
           null-terminated domain name requires more than _len_ bytes,
           getdomainname () returns the first _len_ bytes (glibc) or gives an
           error (libc).
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           setdomainname () can fail with the following errors:
    
           EFAULT _name_ pointed outside of user address space.
    
           EINVAL _len_ was negative or too large.
    
           EPERM The caller did not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in
                  the user namespace associated with its UTS namespace (see
                  namespaces(7)).
    
           getdomainname () can fail with the following errors:
    
           EINVAL For getdomainname () under libc: _name_ is NULL or _name_ is
                  longer than _len_ bytes.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX does not specify these calls.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Since Linux 1.0, the limit on the length of a domain name,
           including the terminating null byte, is 64 bytes.  In older
           kernels, it was 8 bytes.
    
           On most Linux architectures (including x86), there is no
           getdomainname () system call; instead, glibc implements
           getdomainname () as a library function that returns a copy of the
           _domainname_ field returned from a call to uname(2).

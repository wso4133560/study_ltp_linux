    INOTIFY_INIT(2)         Linux Programmer's Manual        INOTIFY_INIT(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           inotify_init, inotify_init1 - initialize an inotify instance
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/inotify.h>
    
           int inotify_init(void);
           int inotify_init1(int _flags_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           For an overview of the inotify API, see inotify(7).
    
           inotify_init () initializes a new inotify instance and returns a
           file descriptor associated with a new inotify event queue.
    
           If _flags_ is 0, then inotify_init1 () is the same as
           inotify_init ().  The following values can be bitwise ORed in
           _flags_ to obtain different behavior:
    
           IN_NONBLOCK
                  Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the open file
                  description (see open(2)) referred to by the new file
                  descriptor.  Using this flag saves extra calls to fcntl(2)
                  to achieve the same result.
    
           IN_CLOEXEC
                  Set the close-on-exec ( FD_CLOEXEC ) flag on the new file
                  descriptor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in
                  open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, these system calls return a new file descriptor.  On
           error, -1 is returned, and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL ( inotify_init1 ()) An invalid value was specified in _flags_.
    
           EMFILE The user limit on the total number of inotify instances
                  has been reached.
    
           EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file
                  descriptors has been reached.
    
           ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
                  has been reached.
    
           ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory is available.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           inotify_init () first appeared in Linux 2.6.13; library support
           was added to glibc in version 2.4.  inotify_init1 () was added in
           Linux 2.6.27; library support was added to glibc in version 2.9.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These system calls are Linux-specific.

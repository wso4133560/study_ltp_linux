    CREATE_MODULE(2)        Linux Programmer's Manual       CREATE_MODULE(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           create_module - create a loadable module entry
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <linux/module.h>
    
           caddr_t create_module(const char  _name_ , size_t _size_ );
    
           _Note_ : No declaration of this system call is provided in glibc
           headers; see NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           _Note_ : This system call is present only in kernels before Linux
           2.6.
    
           create_module () attempts to create a loadable module entry and
           reserve the kernel memory that will be needed to hold the module.
           This system call requires privilege.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, returns the kernel address at which the module will
           reside.  On error, -1 is returned and _errno_ is set to indicate
           the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EEXIST A module by that name already exists.
    
           EFAULT _name_ is outside the program's accessible address space.
    
           EINVAL The requested size is too small even for the module header
                  information.
    
           ENOMEM The kernel could not allocate a contiguous block of memory
                  large enough for the module.
    
           ENOSYS create_module () is not supported in this version of the
                  kernel (e.g., the kernel is version 2.6 or later).
    
           EPERM The caller was not privileged (did not have the
                  CAP_SYS_MODULE capability).
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           This system call is present on Linux only up until kernel 2.4; it
           was removed in Linux 2.6.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           create_module () is Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           This obsolete system call is not supported by glibc.  No
           declaration is provided in glibc headers, but, through a quirk of
           history, glibc versions before 2.23 did export an ABI for this
           system call.  Therefore, in order to employ this system call, it
           was sufficient to manually declare the interface in your code;
           alternatively, you could invoke the system call using syscall(2).

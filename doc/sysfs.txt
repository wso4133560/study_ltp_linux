    SYSFS(5)                Linux Programmer's Manual               SYSFS(5)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           sysfs - a filesystem for exporting kernel objects
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The sysfs filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an
           interface to kernel data structures.  (More precisely, the files
           and directories in sysfs provide a view of the _kobject_ structures
           defined internally within the kernel.)  The files under sysfs
           provide information about devices, kernel modules, filesystems,
           and other kernel components.
    
           The sysfs filesystem is commonly mounted at _/sys_.  Typically, it
           is mounted automatically by the system, but it can also be
           mounted manually using a command such as:
    
               mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
    
           Many of the files in the sysfs filesystem are read-only, but some
           files are writable, allowing kernel variables to be changed.  To
           avoid redundancy, symbolic links are heavily used to connect
           entries across the filesystem tree.
    
       Files and directories
           The following list describes some of the files and directories
           under the _/sys_ hierarchy.
    
           _/sys/block_
                  This subdirectory contains one symbolic link for each
                  block device that has been discovered on the system.  The
                  symbolic links point to corresponding directories under
                  _/sys/devices_.
    
           _/sys/bus_
                  This directory contains one subdirectory for each of the
                  bus types in the kernel.  Inside each of these directories
                  are two subdirectories:
    
                  _devices_
                         This subdirectory contains symbolic links to
                         entries in _/sys/devices_ that correspond to the
                         devices discovered on this bus.
    
                  _drivers_
                         This subdirectory contains one subdirectory for
                         each device driver that is loaded on this bus.
    
           _/sys/class_
                  This subdirectory contains a single layer of further
                  subdirectories for each of the device classes that have
                  been registered on the system (e.g., terminals, network
                  devices, block devices, graphics devices, sound devices,
                  and so on).  Inside each of these subdirectories are
                  symbolic links for each of the devices in this class.
                  These symbolic links refer to entries in the _/sys/devices_
                  directory.
    
           _/sys/class/net_
                  Each of the entries in this directory is a symbolic link
                  representing one of the real or virtual networking devices
                  that are visible in the network namespace of the process
                  that is accessing the directory.  Each of these symbolic
                  links refers to entries in the _/sys/devices_ directory.
    
           _/sys/dev_
                  This directory contains two subdirectories _block_ / and
                  _char/_ , corresponding, respectively, to the block and
                  character devices on the system.  Inside each of these
                  subdirectories are symbolic links with names of the form
                  _major-ID_ : _minor-ID_ , where the ID values correspond to the
                  major and minor ID of a specific device.  Each symbolic
                  link points to the sysfs directory for a device.  The
                  symbolic links inside _/sys/dev_ thus provide an easy way to
                  look up the sysfs interface using the device IDs returned
                  by a call to stat(2) (or similar).
    
                  The following shell session shows an example from
                  _/sys/dev_ :
    
                      $ stat -c "%t %T" /dev/null
                      1 3
                      $ readlink /sys/dev/char/1\:3
                      ../../devices/virtual/mem/null
                      $ ls -Fd /sys/devices/virtual/mem/null
                      /sys/devices/virtual/mem/null/
                      $ ls -d1 /sys/devices/virtual/mem/null/
                      /sys/devices/virtual/mem/null/dev
                      /sys/devices/virtual/mem/null/power/
                      /sys/devices/virtual/mem/null/subsystem@
                      /sys/devices/virtual/mem/null/uevent
    
           _/sys/devices_
                  This is a directory that contains a filesystem
                  representation of the kernel device tree, which is a
                  hierarchy of _device_ structures within the kernel.
    
           _/sys/firmware_
                  This subdirectory contains interfaces for viewing and
                  manipulating firmware-specific objects and attributes.
    
           _/sys/fs_
                  This directory contains subdirectories for some
                  filesystems.  A filesystem will have a subdirectory here
                  only if it chose to explicitly create the subdirectory.
    
           _/sys/fs/cgroup_
                  This directory conventionally is used as a mount point for
                  a tmpfs(5) filesystem containing mount points for
                  cgroups(7) filesystems.
    
           _/sys/fs/smackfs_
                  The directory contains configuration files for the SMACK
                  LSM.  See the kernel source file
                  _Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/Smack.rst_.
    
           _/sys/hypervisor_
                  [To be documented]
    
           _/sys/kernel_
                  This subdirectory contains various files and
                  subdirectories that provide information about the running
                  kernel.
    
           _/sys/kernel/cgroup/_
                  For information about the files in this directory, see
                  cgroups(7).
    
           _/sys/kernel/debug/tracing_
                  Mount point for the _tracefs_ filesystem used by the
                  kernel's _ftrace_ facility.  (For information on _ftrace_ , see
                  the kernel source file _Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt_.)
    
           _/sys/kernel/mm_
                  This subdirectory contains various files and
                  subdirectories that provide information about the kernel's
                  memory management subsystem.
    
           _/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages_
                  This subdirectory contains one subdirectory for each of
                  the huge page sizes that the system supports.  The
                  subdirectory name indicates the huge page size (e.g.,
                  _hugepages-2048kB_ ).  Within each of these subdirectories is
                  a set of files that can be used to view and (in some
                  cases) change settings associated with that huge page
                  size.  For further information, see the kernel source file
                  _Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst_.
    
           _/sys/module_
                  This subdirectory contains one subdirectory for each
                  module that is loaded into the kernel.  The name of each
                  directory is the name of the module.  In each of the
                  subdirectories, there may be following files:
    
                  _coresize_
                         [to be documented]
    
                  _initsize_
                         [to be documented]
    
                  _initstate_
                         [to be documented]
    
                  _refcnt_ [to be documented]
    
                  _srcversion_
                         [to be documented]
    
                  _taint_  [to be documented]
    
                  _uevent_ [to be documented]
    
                  _version_
                         [to be documented]
    
                  In each of the subdirectories, there may be following
                  subdirectories:
    
                  _drivers_
                         [To be documented]
    
                  _holders_
                         [To be documented]
    
                  _notes_  [To be documented]
    
                  _parameters_
                         This directory contains one file for each module
                         parameter, with each file containing the value of
                         the corresponding parameter.  Some of these files
                         are writable, allowing the
    
                  _sections_
                         This subdirectories contains files with information
                         about module sections.  This information is mainly
                         used for debugging.

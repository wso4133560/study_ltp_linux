               Since glibc 2.19:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               In glibc up to and including 2.19:
                   _BSD_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This interface is obsoleted by rcmd(3).
    
           The rexec () function looks up the host _ahost_ using
           gethostbyname(3), returning -1 if the host does not exist.
           Otherwise, _ahost_ is set to the standard name of the host.  If a
           username and password are both specified, then these are used to
           authenticate to the foreign host; otherwise the environment and
           then the _.netrc_ file in user's home directory are searched for
           appropriate information.  If all this fails, the user is prompted
           for the information.
    
           The port _inport_ specifies which well-known DARPA Internet port to
           use for the connection; the call _getservbyname("exec", "tcp")_
           (see getservent(3)) will return a pointer to a structure that
           contains the necessary port.  The protocol for connection is
           described in detail in rexecd (8).
    
           If the connection succeeds, a socket in the Internet domain of
           type SOCK_STREAM is returned to the caller, and given to the
           remote command as _stdin_ and _stdout_.  If _fd2p_ is nonzero, then an
           auxiliary channel to a control process will be setup, and a file
           descriptor for it will be placed in _fd2p_.  The control process
           will return diagnostic output from the command (unit 2) on this
           channel, and will also accept bytes on this channel as being UNIX
           signal numbers, to be forwarded to the process group of the
           command.  The diagnostic information returned does not include
           remote authorization failure, as the secondary connection is set
           up after authorization has been verified.  If _fd2p_ is 0, then the
           _stderr_ (unit 2 of the remote command) will be made the same as
           the _stdout_ and no provision is made for sending arbitrary signals
           to the remote process, although you may be able to get its
           attention by using out-of-band data.
    
       rexec_af()
           The rexec () function works over IPv4 ( AF_INET ).  By contrast, the
           rexec_af () function provides an extra argument, _af_ , that allows
           the caller to select the protocol.  This argument can be
           specified as AF_INET , AF_INET6 , or AF_UNSPEC (to allow the
           implementation to select the protocol).
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The rexec_af () function was added to glibc in version 2.2.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These functions are not in POSIX.1.  The rexec () function first
           appeared in 4.2BSD, and is present on the BSDs, Solaris, and many
           other systems.  The rexec_af () function is more recent, and less
           widespread.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           The rexec () function sends the unencrypted password across the
           network.
    
           The underlying service is considered a big security hole and
           therefore not enabled on many sites; see rexecd (8) for
           explanations.

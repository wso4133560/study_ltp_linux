    TTYTYPE(5)              Linux Programmer's Manual             TTYTYPE(5)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           ttytype - terminal device to default terminal type mapping
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The _/etc/ttytype_ file associates termcap(5)/terminfo(5) terminal
           type names with tty lines.  Each line consists of a terminal
           type, followed by whitespace, followed by a tty name (a device
           name without the _/dev/_ ) prefix.
    
           This association is used by the program tset(1) to set the
           environment variable TERM to the default terminal name for the
           user's current tty.
    
           This facility was designed for a traditional time-sharing
           environment featuring character-cell terminals hardwired to a
           UNIX minicomputer.  It is little used on modern workstation and
           personal UNIX systems.

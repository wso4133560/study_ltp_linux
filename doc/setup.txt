    SETUP(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               SETUP(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           setup - setup devices and filesystems, mount root filesystem
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int setup(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           setup () is called once from within _linux/init/main.c_.  It calls
           initialization functions for devices and filesystems configured
           into the kernel and then mounts the root filesystem.
    
           No user process may call setup ().  Any user process, even a
           process with superuser permission, will receive EPERM.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           setup () always returns -1 for a user process.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EPERM Always, for a user process.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           Since Linux 2.1.121, no such function exists anymore.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This function is Linux-specific, and should not be used in
           programs intended to be portable, or indeed in any programs at
           all.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The calling sequence varied: at some times setup () has had a
           single argument _void BIOS_ and at other times a single argument
           _int magic_.

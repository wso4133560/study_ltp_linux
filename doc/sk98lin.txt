## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Note : This obsolete driver was removed from the kernel in version
           2.6.26.
    
           sk98lin is the Gigabit Ethernet driver for Marvell and SysKonnect
           network adapter cards.  It supports SysKonnect SK-98xx/SK-95xx
           compliant Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and any Yukon compliant
           chipset.
    
           When loading the driver using insmod, parameters for the network
           adapter cards might be stated as a sequence of comma separated
           commands.  If for instance two network adapters are installed and
           AutoNegotiation on Port A of the first adapter should be ON, but
           on the Port A of the second adapter switched OFF, one must enter:
    
              insmod sk98lin.o AutoNeg_A=On,Off
    
           After sk98lin is bound to one or more adapter cards and the _/proc_
           filesystem is mounted on your system, a dedicated statistics file
           will be created in the folder _/proc/net/sk98lin_ for all ports of
           the installed network adapter cards.  Those files are named
           _eth[x]_ , where _x_ is the number of the interface that has been
           assigned to a dedicated port by the system.
    
           If loading is finished, any desired IP address can be assigned to
           the respective _eth[x]_ interface using the ifconfig(8) command.
           This causes the adapter to connect to the Ethernet and to display
           a status message on the console saying "ethx: network connection
           up using port y" followed by the configured or detected
           connection parameters.
    
           The sk98lin also supports large frames (also called jumbo
           frames).  Using jumbo frames can improve throughput tremendously
           when transferring large amounts of data.  To enable large frames,
           the MTU (maximum transfer unit) size for an interface is to be
           set to a high value.  The default MTU size is 1500 and can be
           changed up to 9000 (bytes).  Setting the MTU size can be done
           when assigning the IP address to the interface or later by using
           the ifconfig(8) command with the mtu parameter.  If for instance
           eth0 needs an IP address and a large frame MTU size, the
           following two commands might be used:
    
               ifconfig eth0 10.1.1.1
               ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000
    
           Those two commands might even be combined into one:
    
               ifconfig eth0 10.1.1.1 mtu 9000
    
           Note that large frames can be used only if permitted by your
           network infrastructure.  This means, that any switch being used
           in your Ethernet must also support large frames.  Quite some
           switches support large frames, but need to be configured to do
           so.  Most of the times, their default setting is to support only
           standard frames with an MTU size of 1500 (bytes).  In addition to
           the switches inside the network, all network adapters that are to
           be used must also be enabled regarding jumbo frames.  If an
           adapter is not set to receive large frames, it will simply drop
           them.
    
           Switching back to the standard Ethernet frame size can be done by
           using the ifconfig(8) command again:
    
               ifconfig eth0 mtu 1500
    
           The Marvell/SysKonnect Gigabit Ethernet driver for Linux is able
           to support VLAN and Link Aggregation according to IEEE standards
           802.1, 802.1q, and 802.3ad.  Those features are available only
           after installation of open source modules which can be found on
           the Internet:
    
           _VLAN_ : ⟨http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html⟩
           _Link Aggregation_ : ⟨http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~yumo⟩
    
           Note that Marvell/SysKonnect does not offer any support for these
           open source modules and does not take the responsibility for any
           kind of failures or problems arising when using these modules.
    
       Parameters
           Speed_A= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter is used to set the speed capabilities of
                  port A of an adapter card.  It is valid only for Yukon
                  copper adapters.  Possible values are: _10_ , _100_ , _1000_ , or
                  _Auto_ ; _Auto_ is the default.  Usually, the speed is
                  negotiated between the two ports during link
                  establishment.  If this fails, a port can be forced to a
                  specific setting with this parameter.
    
           Speed_B= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter is used to set the speed capabilities of
                  port B of an adapter card.  It is valid only for Yukon
                  copper adapters.  Possible values are: _10_ , _100_ , _1000_ , or
                  _Auto_ ; _Auto_ is the default.  Usually, the speed is
                  negotiated between the two ports during link
                  establishment.  If this fails, a port can be forced to a
                  specific setting with this parameter.
    
           AutoNeg_A= _i,j,..._
                  Enables or disables the use of autonegotiation of port A
                  of an adapter card.  Possible values are: _On_ , _Off_ , or
                  _Sense_ ; _On_ is the default.  The _Sense_ mode automatically
                  detects whether the link partner supports auto-negotiation
                  or not.
    
           AutoNeg_B= _i,j,..._
                  Enables or disables the use of autonegotiation of port B
                  of an adapter card.  Possible values are: _On_ , _Off_ , or
                  _Sense_ ; _On_ is the default.  The _Sense_ mode automatically
                  detects whether the link partner supports auto-negotiation
                  or not.
    
           DupCap_A= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter indicates the duplex mode to be used for
                  port A of an adapter card.  Possible values are: _Half_ ,
                  _Full_ , or _Both_ ; _Both_ is the default.  This parameter is
                  relevant only if AutoNeg_A of port A is not set to _Sense_.
                  If AutoNeg_A is set to _On_ , all three values of DupCap_A (
                  _Half_ , _Full_ , or _Both_ ) might be stated.  If AutoNeg_A is set
                  to _Off_ , only DupCap_A values _Full_ and _Half_ are allowed.
                  This DupCap_A parameter is useful if your link partner
                  does not support all possible duplex combinations.
    
           DupCap_B= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter indicates the duplex mode to be used for
                  port B of an adapter card.  Possible values are: _Half_ ,
                  _Full_ , or _Both_ ; _Both_ is the default.  This parameter is
                  relevant only if AutoNeg_B of port B is not set to _Sense_.
                  If AutoNeg_B is set to _On_ , all three values of DupCap_B (
                  _Half_ , _Full_ , or _Both_ ) might be stated.  If AutoNeg_B is set
                  to _Off_ , only DupCap_B values _Full_ and _Half_ are allowed.
                  This DupCap_B parameter is useful if your link partner
                  does not support all possible duplex combinations.
    
           FlowCtrl_A= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter can be used to set the flow control
                  capabilities the port reports during auto-negotiation.
                  Possible values are: _Sym_ , _SymOrRem_ , _LocSend_ , or _None_ ;
                  _SymOrRem_ is the default.  The different modes have the
                  following meaning:
    
                  _Sym_ = Symmetric
                   both link partners are allowed to send PAUSE frames
                  _SymOrRem_ = SymmetricOrRemote
                   both or only remote partner are allowed to send PAUSE
                  frames
                  _LocSend_ = LocalSend
                   only local link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
                  _None_ = None
                   no link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
    
                  Note that this parameter is ignored if AutoNeg_A is set to
                  _Off_.
    
           FlowCtrl_B= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter can be used to set the flow control
                  capabilities the port reports during auto-negotiation.
                  Possible values are: _Sym_ , _SymOrRem_ , _LocSend_ , or _None_ ;
                  _SymOrRem_ is the default.  The different modes have the
                  following meaning:
    
                  _Sym_ = Symmetric
                   both link partners are allowed to send PAUSE frames
                  _SymOrRem_ = SymmetricOrRemote
                   both or only remote partner are allowed to send PAUSE
                  frames
                  _LocSend_ = LocalSend
                   only local link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
                  _None_ = None
                   no link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
    
                  Note that this parameter is ignored if AutoNeg_B is set to
                  _Off_.
    
           Role_A= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter is valid only for 1000Base-T adapter cards.
                  For two 1000Base-T ports to communicate, one must take the
                  role of the master (providing timing information), while
                  the other must be the slave.  Possible values are: _Auto_ ,
                  _Master_ , or _Slave_ ; _Auto_ is the default.  Usually, the role
                  of a port is negotiated between two ports during link
                  establishment, but if that fails the port A of an adapter
                  card can be forced to a specific setting with this
                  parameter.
    
           Role_B= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter is valid only for 1000Base-T adapter cards.
                  For two 1000Base-T ports to communicate, one must take the
                  role of the master (providing timing information), while
                  the other must be the slave.  Possible values are: _Auto_ ,
                  _Master_ , or _Slave_ ; _Auto_ is the default.  Usually, the role
                  of a port is negotiated between two ports during link
                  establishment, but if that fails the port B of an adapter
                  card can be forced to a specific setting with this
                  parameter.
    
           ConType= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter is a combination of all five per-port
                  parameters within one single parameter.  This simplifies
                  the configuration of both ports of an adapter card.  The
                  different values of this variable reflect the most
                  meaningful combinations of port parameters.  Possible
                  values and their corresponding combination of per-port
                  parameters:
    
                  ConType   DupCap   AutoNeg   FlowCtrl   Role   Speed
                  _Auto_      Both     On        SymOrRem   Auto   Auto
                  _100FD_     Full     Off       None       Auto   100
                  _100HD_     Half     Off       None       Auto   100
                  _10FD_      Full     Off       None       Auto   10
                  _10HD_      Half     Off       None       Auto   10
    
                  Stating any other port parameter together with this
                  _ConType_ parameter will result in a merged configuration of
                  those settings.  This is due to the fact, that the per-
                  port parameters (e.g., _Speed_A_ ) have a higher priority
                  than the combined variable _ConType_.
    
           Moderation= _i,j,..._
                  Interrupt moderation is employed to limit the maximum
                  number of interrupts the driver has to serve.  That is,
                  one or more interrupts (which indicate any transmit or
                  receive packet to be processed) are queued until the
                  driver processes them.  When queued interrupts are to be
                  served, is determined by the _IntsPerSec_ parameter, which
                  is explained later below.  Possible moderation modes are:
                  _None_ , _Static_ , or _Dynamic_ ; _None_ is the default.  The
                  different modes have the following meaning:
    
                  _None_ No interrupt moderation is applied on the adapter
                  card.  Therefore, each transmit or receive interrupt is
                  served immediately as soon as it appears on the interrupt
                  line of the adapter card.
    
                  _Static_ Interrupt moderation is applied on the adapter
                  card.  All transmit and receive interrupts are queued
                  until a complete moderation interval ends.  If such a
                  moderation interval ends, all queued interrupts are
                  processed in one big bunch without any delay.  The term
                  _Static_ reflects the fact, that interrupt moderation is
                  always enabled, regardless how much network load is
                  currently passing via a particular interface.  In
                  addition, the duration of the moderation interval has a
                  fixed length that never changes while the driver is
                  operational.
    
                  _Dynamic_ Interrupt moderation might be applied on the
                  adapter card, depending on the load of the system.  If the
                  driver detects that the system load is too high, the
                  driver tries to shield the system against too much network
                  load by enabling interrupt moderation.  If—at a later
                  time—the CPU utilization decreases again (or if the
                  network load is negligible), the interrupt moderation will
                  automatically be disabled.
    
                  Interrupt moderation should be used when the driver has to
                  handle one or more interfaces with a high network load,
                  which—as a consequence—leads also to a high CPU
                  utilization.  When moderation is applied in such high
                  network load situations, CPU load might be reduced by
                  20–30% on slow computers.
    
                  Note that the drawback of using interrupt moderation is an
                  increase of the round-trip-time (RTT), due to the queuing
                  and serving of interrupts at dedicated moderation times.
    
           IntsPerSec= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter determines the length of any interrupt
                  moderation interval.  Assuming that static interrupt
                  moderation is to be used, an _IntsPerSec_ parameter value of
                  2000 will lead to an interrupt moderation interval of 500
                  microseconds.  Possible values for this parameter are in
                  the range of 30...40000 (interrupts per second).  The
                  default value is 2000.
    
                  This parameter is used only if either static or dynamic
                  interrupt moderation is enabled on a network adapter card.
                  This parameter is ignored if no moderation is applied.
    
                  Note that the duration of the moderation interval is to be
                  chosen with care.  At first glance, selecting a very long
                  duration (e.g., only 100 interrupts per second) seems to
                  be meaningful, but the increase of packet-processing delay
                  is tremendous.  On the other hand, selecting a very short
                  moderation time might compensate the use of any moderation
                  being applied.
    
           PrefPort= _i,j,..._
                  This parameter is used to force the preferred port to A or
                  B (on dual-port network adapters).  The preferred port is
                  the one that is used if both ports A and B are detected as
                  fully functional.  Possible values are: _A_ or _B_ ; _A_ is the
                  default.
    
           RlmtMode= _i,j,..._
                  RLMT monitors the status of the port.  If the link of the
                  active port fails, RLMT switches immediately to the
                  standby link.  The virtual link is maintained as long as
                  at least one "physical" link is up.  This parameters
                  states how RLMT should monitor both ports.  Possible
                  values are: _CheckLinkState_ , _CheckLocalPort_ , _CheckSeg_ , or
                  _DualNet_ ; _CheckLinkState_ is the default.  The different
                  modes have the following meaning:
    
                  _CheckLinkState_ Check link state only: RLMT uses the link
                  state reported by the adapter hardware for each individual
                  port to determine whether a port can be used for all
                  network traffic or not.
    
                  _CheckLocalPort_ In this mode, RLMT monitors the network
                  path between the two ports of an adapter by regularly
                  exchanging packets between them.  This mode requires a
                  network configuration in which the two ports are able to
                  "see" each other (i.e., there must not be any router
                  between the ports).
    
                  _CheckSeg_ Check local port and segmentation: This mode
                  supports the same functions as the CheckLocalPort mode and
                  additionally checks network segmentation between the
                  ports.  Therefore, this mode is to be used only if Gigabit
                  Ethernet switches are installed on the network that have
                  been configured to use the Spanning Tree protocol.
    
                  _DualNet_ In this mode, ports A and B are used as separate
                  devices.  If you have a dual port adapter, port A will be
                  configured as _eth[x]_ and port B as _eth[x+1]_.  Both ports
                  can be used independently with distinct IP addresses.  The
                  preferred port setting is not used.  RLMT is turned off.
    
                  Note that RLMT modes _CheckLocalPort_ and _CheckLinkState_ are
                  designed to operate in configurations where a network path
                  between the ports on one adapter exists.  Moreover, they
                  are not designed to work where adapters are connected
                  back-to-back.

## CONFIGURATION         top
    
    
           The dsp56k device is a character device with major number 55 and
           minor number 0.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The Motorola DSP56001 is a fully programmable 24-bit digital
           signal processor found in Atari Falcon030-compatible computers.
           The _dsp56k_ special file is used to control the DSP56001, and to
           send and receive data using the bidirectional handshaked host
           port.
    
           To send a data stream to the signal processor, use write(2) to
           the device, and read(2) to receive processed data.  The data can
           be sent or received in 8, 16, 24, or 32-bit quantities on the
           host side, but will always be seen as 24-bit quantities in the
           DSP56001.
    
           The following ioctl(2) calls are used to control the _dsp56k_
           device:
    
           DSP56K_UPLOAD
                  resets the DSP56001 and uploads a program.  The third
                  ioctl(2) argument must be a pointer to a _struct_
                  _dsp56k_upload_ with members _bin_ pointing to a DSP56001
                  binary program, and _len_ set to the length of the program,
                  counted in 24-bit words.
    
           DSP56K_SET_TX_WSIZE
                  sets the transmit word size.  Allowed values are in the
                  range 1 to 4, and is the number of bytes that will be sent
                  at a time to the DSP56001.  These data quantities will
                  either be padded with bytes containing zero, or truncated
                  to fit the native 24-bit data format of the DSP56001.
    
           DSP56K_SET_RX_WSIZE
                  sets the receive word size.  Allowed values are in the
                  range 1 to 4, and is the number of bytes that will be
                  received at a time from the DSP56001.  These data
                  quantities will either truncated, or padded with a null
                  byte ('\0') to fit the native 24-bit data format of the
                  DSP56001.
    
           DSP56K_HOST_FLAGS
                  read and write the host flags.  The host flags are four
                  general-purpose bits that can be read by both the hosting
                  computer and the DSP56001.  Bits 0 and 1 can be written by
                  the host, and bits 2 and 3 can be written by the DSP56001.
    
                  To access the host flags, the third ioctl(2) argument must
                  be a pointer to a _struct dsp56k_host_flags_.  If bit 0 or 1
                  is set in the _dir_ member, the corresponding bit in _out_
                  will be written to the host flags.  The state of all host
                  flags will be returned in the lower four bits of the
                  _status_ member.
    
           DSP56K_HOST_CMD
                  sends a host command.  Allowed values are in the range 0
                  to 31, and is a user-defined command handled by the
                  program running in the DSP56001.

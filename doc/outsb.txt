## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This family of functions is used to do low-level port input and
           output.  The out functions do port output, the in functions do
           port input; the b-suffix functions are byte-width and the w-
           suffix functions word-width; the _p-suffix functions pause until
           the I/O completes.
    
           They are primarily designed for internal kernel use, but can be
           used from user space.
    
           You must compile with -O or -O2 or similar.  The functions are
           defined as inline macros, and will not be substituted in without
           optimization enabled, causing unresolved references at link time.
    
           You use ioperm(2) or alternatively iopl(2) to tell the kernel to
           allow the user space application to access the I/O ports in
           question.  Failure to do this will cause the application to
           receive a segmentation fault.

           outb () and friends are hardware-specific.  The _value_ argument is
           passed first and the _port_ argument is passed second, which is the
           opposite order from most DOS implementations.

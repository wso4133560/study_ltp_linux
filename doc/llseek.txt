## NAME         top
    
    
           _llseek - reposition read/write file offset
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int _llseek(unsigned int _fd_ , unsigned long _offset_high_ ,
                       unsigned long _offset_low_ , loff_t  _result_ ,
                       unsigned int _whence_ );
    
           _Note_ : There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Note: for information about the llseek (3) library function, see
           lseek64(3).
    
           The _llseek () system call repositions the offset of the open file
           description associated with the file descriptor _fd_ to the value
    
                  (offset_high << 32) | offset_low
    
           This new offset is a byte offset relative to the beginning of the
           file, the current file offset, or the end of the file, depending
           on whether _whence_ is SEEK_SET , SEEK_CUR , or SEEK_END ,
           respectively.
    
           The new file offset is returned in the argument _result_.  The
           type _loff_t_ is a 64-bit signed type.
    
           This system call exists on various 32-bit platforms to support
           seeking to large file offsets.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           Upon successful completion, _llseek () returns 0.  Otherwise, a
           value of -1 is returned and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EBADF _fd_ is not an open file descriptor.
    
           EFAULT Problem with copying results to user space.
    
           EINVAL _whence_ is invalid.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This function is Linux-specific, and should not be used in
           programs intended to be portable.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call.  To invoke
           it directly, use syscall(2).  However, you probably want to use
           the lseek(2) wrapper function instead.

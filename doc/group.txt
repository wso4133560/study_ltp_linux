           group - user group file
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The _/etc/group_ file is a text file that defines the groups on the
           system.  There is one entry per line, with the following format:
    
               group_name:password:GID:user_list
    
           The fields are as follows:
    
           _group_name_
                  the name of the group.
    
           _password_
                  the (encrypted) group password.  If this field is empty,
                  no password is needed.
    
           _GID_    the numeric group ID.
    
           _user_list_
                  a list of the usernames that are members of this group,
                  separated by commas.

## BUGS         top
    
    
           As the 4.2BSD initgroups(3) man page says: no one seems to keep
           _/etc/group_ up-to-date.

## NAME         top
    
    
           ldconfig - configure dynamic linker run-time bindings
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           /sbin/ldconfig [ -nNvXV ] [ -f _conf_ ] [ -C _cache_ ] [ -r _root_ ]

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           ldconfig creates the necessary links and cache to the most recent
           shared libraries found in the directories specified on the
           command line, in the file _/etc/ld.so.conf_ , and in the trusted
           directories, _/lib_ and _/usr/lib_ (on some 64-bit architectures such
           as x86-64, _/lib_ and _/usr/lib_ are the trusted directories for
           32-bit libraries, while _/lib64_ and _/usr/lib64_ are used for 64-bit
           libraries).
    
           The cache is used by the run-time linker, _ld.so_ or _ld-linux.so_.
           ldconfig checks the header and filenames of the libraries it
           encounters when determining which versions should have their
           links updated.
    
           ldconfig will attempt to deduce the type of ELF libraries (i.e.,
           libc5 or libc6/glibc) based on what C libraries, if any, the
           library was linked against.
    
           Some existing libraries do not contain enough information to
           allow the deduction of their type.  Therefore, the
           _/etc/ld.so.conf_ file format allows the specification of an
           expected type.  This is used _only_ for those ELF libraries which
           we can not work out.  The format is "dirname=TYPE", where TYPE
           can be libc4, libc5, or libc6.  (This syntax also works on the
           command line.)  Spaces are _not_ allowed.  Also see the -p option.
           ldconfig should normally be run by the superuser as it may
           require write permission on some root owned directories and
           files.
    
           Note that ldconfig will only look at files that are named
           _lib.so_ (for regular shared objects) or _ld-.so_ (for the
           dynamic loader itself).  Other files will be ignored.  Also,
           ldconfig expects a certain pattern to how the symlinks are set
           up, like this example, where the middle file ( libfoo.so.1 here)
           is the SONAME for the library:
    
               libfoo.so -> libfoo.so.1 -> libfoo.so.1.12
    
           Failure to follow this pattern may result in compatibility issues
           after an upgrade.
    
## OPTIONS         top
    
    
           -c _fmt_ , --format= _fmt_
                  (Since glibc 2.2) Cache format to use: _old_ , _new_ , or
                  _compat_.  Since glibc 2.32, the default is _new_.  Before
                  that, it was _compat_.
    
           -C _cache_
                  Use _cache_ instead of _/etc/ld.so.cache_.
    
           -f _conf_
                  Use _conf_ instead of _/etc/ld.so.conf_.
    
           -i , --ignore-aux-cache
                  (Since glibc 2.7) Ignore auxiliary cache file.
    
           -l (Since glibc 2.2) Library mode.  Manually link individual
                  libraries.  Intended for use by experts only.
    
           -n Process only the directories specified on the command
                  line.  Don't process the trusted directories, nor those
                  specified in _/etc/ld.so.conf_.  Implies -N.
    
           -N Don't rebuild the cache.  Unless -X is also specified,
                  links are still updated.
    
           -p , --print-cache
                  Print the lists of directories and candidate libraries
                  stored in the current cache.
    
           -r _root_
                  Change to and use _root_ as the root directory.
    
           -v , --verbose
                  Verbose mode.  Print current version number, the name of
                  each directory as it is scanned, and any links that are
                  created.  Overrides quiet mode.
    
           -V , --version
                  Print program version.
    
           -X Don't update links.  Unless -N is also specified, the
                  cache is still rebuilt.
    
## FILES         top
    
    
           _/lib/ld.so_
                  Run-time linker/loader.
           _/etc/ld.so.conf_
                  File containing a list of directories, one per line, in
                  which to search for libraries.
           _/etc/ld.so.cache_
                  File containing an ordered list of libraries found in the
                  directories specified in _/etc/ld.so.conf_ , as well as those
                  found in the trusted directories.

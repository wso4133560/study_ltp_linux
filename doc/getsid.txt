## NAME         top
    
    
           getsid - get session ID
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           pid_t getsid(pid_t _pid_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           getsid ():
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
                   || / Since glibc 2.12: / _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           getsid (0) returns the session ID of the calling process.
           getsid () returns the session ID of the process with process ID
           _pid_.  If _pid_ is 0, getsid () returns the session ID of the calling
           process.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, a session ID is returned.  On error, _(pid_t) -1_ is
           returned, and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EPERM A process with process ID _pid_ exists, but it is not in the
                  same session as the calling process, and the
                  implementation considers this an error.
    
           ESRCH No process with process ID _pid_ was found.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           This system call is available on Linux since version 2.0.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Linux does not return EPERM.
    
           See credentials(7) for a description of sessions and session IDs.

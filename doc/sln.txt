## NAME         top
    
    
           sln - create symbolic links
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           sln _source dest_
           sln _filelist_
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The sln program creates symbolic links.  Unlike the ln(1)
           program, it is statically linked.  This means that if for some
           reason the dynamic linker is not working, sln can be used to make
           symbolic links to dynamic libraries.
    
           The command line has two forms.  In the first form, it creates
           _dest_ as a new symbolic link to _source_.
    
           In the second form, _filelist_ is a list of space-separated
           pathname pairs, and the effect is as if sln was executed once for
           each line of the file, with the two pathnames as the arguments.
    
           The sln program supports no command-line options.

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Data written to the _/dev/null_ and _/dev/zero_ special files is
           discarded.
    
           Reads from _/dev/null_ always return end of file (i.e., read(2)
           returns 0), whereas reads from _/dev/zero_ always return bytes
           containing zero ('\0' characters).
    
           These devices are typically created by:
    
               mknod -m 666 /dev/null c 1 3
               mknod -m 666 /dev/zero c 1 5
               chown root:root /dev/null /dev/zero
    
## FILES         top
    
    
           _/dev/null_
           _/dev/zero_
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           If these devices are not writable and readable for all users,
           many programs will act strangely.
    
           Since Linux 2.6.31, reads from _/dev/zero_ are interruptible by
           signals.  (This change was made to help with bad latencies for
           large reads from _/dev/zero_.)

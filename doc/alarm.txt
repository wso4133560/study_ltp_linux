    ALARM(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               ALARM(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           alarm - set an alarm clock for delivery of a signal
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           unsigned int alarm(unsigned int _seconds_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           alarm () arranges for a SIGALRM signal to be delivered to the
           calling process in _seconds_ seconds.
    
           If _seconds_ is zero, any pending alarm is canceled.
    
           In any event any previously set alarm () is canceled.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           alarm () returns the number of seconds remaining until any
           previously scheduled alarm was due to be delivered, or zero if
           there was no previously scheduled alarm.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           alarm () and setitimer(2) share the same timer; calls to one will
           interfere with use of the other.
    
           Alarms created by alarm () are preserved across execve(2) and are
           not inherited by children created via fork(2).
    
           sleep(3) may be implemented using SIGALRM ; mixing calls to
           alarm () and sleep(3) is a bad idea.
    
           Scheduling delays can, as ever, cause the execution of the
           process to be delayed by an arbitrary amount of time.

## NAME         top
    
    
           nscd - name service cache daemon
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           nscd is a daemon that provides a cache for the most common name
           service requests.  The default configuration file,
           _/etc/nscd.conf_ , determines the behavior of the cache daemon.  See
           nscd.conf(5).
    
           nscd provides caching for accesses of the passwd(5), group(5),
           hosts(5) services(5) and _netgroup_ databases through standard libc
           interfaces, such as getpwnam(3), getpwuid(3), getgrnam(3),
           getgrgid(3), gethostbyname(3), and others.
    
           There are two caches for each database: a positive one for items
           found, and a negative one for items not found.  Each cache has a
           separate TTL (time-to-live) period for its data.  Note that the
           shadow file is specifically not cached.  getspnam(3) calls remain
           uncached as a result.
    
## OPTIONS         top
    
    
           --help will give you a list with all options and what they do.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The daemon will try to watch for changes in configuration files
           appropriate for each database (e.g., _/etc/passwd_ for the _passwd_
           database or _/etc/hosts_ and _/etc/resolv.conf_ for the _hosts_
           database), and flush the cache when these are changed.  However,
           this will happen only after a short delay (unless the inotify(7)
           mechanism is available and glibc 2.9 or later is available), and
           this auto-detection does not cover configuration files required
           by nonstandard NSS modules, if any are specified in
           _/etc/nsswitch.conf_.  In that case, you need to run the following
           command after changing the configuration file of the database so
           that nscd invalidates its cache:
    
               $ nscd -i _< database>_

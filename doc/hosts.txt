## NAME         top
    
    
           hosts - static table lookup for hostnames
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           /etc/hosts
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This manual page describes the format of the _/etc/hosts_ file.
           This file is a simple text file that associates IP addresses with
           hostnames, one line per IP address.  For each host a single line
           should be present with the following information:
    
                  IP_address canonical_hostname [aliases...]
    
           The IP address can conform to either IPv4 or IPv6.  Fields of the
           entry are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab
           characters.  Text from a "#" character until the end of the line
           is a comment, and is ignored.  Host names may contain only
           alphanumeric characters, minus signs ("-"), and periods (".").
           They must begin with an alphabetic character and end with an
           alphanumeric character.  Optional aliases provide for name
           changes, alternate spellings, shorter hostnames, or generic
           hostnames (for example, _localhost_ ).  If required, a host may have
           two separate entries in this file; one for each version of the
           Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6).
    
           The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) Server implements the
           Internet name server for UNIX systems.  It augments or replaces
           the _/etc/hosts_ file or hostname lookup, and frees a host from
           relying on _/etc/hosts_ being up to date and complete.
    
           In modern systems, even though the host table has been superseded
           by DNS, it is still widely used for:
    
           bootstrapping
                  Most systems have a small host table containing the name
                  and address information for important hosts on the local
                  network.  This is useful when DNS is not running, for
                  example during system bootup.
    
           NIS Sites that use NIS use the host table as input to the NIS
                  host database.  Even though NIS can be used with DNS, most
                  NIS sites still use the host table with an entry for all
                  local hosts as a backup.
    
           isolated nodes
                  Very small sites that are isolated from the network use
                  the host table instead of DNS.  If the local information
                  rarely changes, and the network is not connected to the
                  Internet, DNS offers little advantage.

           Modifications to this file normally take effect immediately,
           except in cases where the file is cached by applications.
    
       Historical notes
           RFC 952 gave the original format for the host table, though it
           has since changed.
    
           Before the advent of DNS, the host table was the only way of
           resolving hostnames on the fledgling Internet.  Indeed, this file
           could be created from the official host data base maintained at
           the Network Information Control Center (NIC), though local
           changes were often required to bring it up to date regarding
           unofficial aliases and/or unknown hosts.  The NIC no longer
           maintains the hosts.txt files, though looking around at the time
           of writing (circa 2000), there are historical hosts.txt files on
           the WWW.  I just found three, from 92, 94, and 95.

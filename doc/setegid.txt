    SETEUID(2)              Linux Programmer's Manual             SETEUID(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           seteuid, setegid - set effective user or group ID
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int seteuid(uid_t _euid_ );
           int setegid(gid_t _egid_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           seteuid (), setegid ():
               _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
                   || / Glibc <= 2.19: / _BSD_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           seteuid () sets the effective user ID of the calling process.
           Unprivileged processes may only set the effective user ID to the
           real user ID, the effective user ID or the saved set-user-ID.
    
           Precisely the same holds for setegid () with "group" instead of
           "user".
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
           _Note_ : there are cases where seteuid () can fail even when the
           caller is UID 0; it is a grave security error to omit checking
           for a failure return from seteuid ().
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL The target user or group ID is not valid in this user
                  namespace.
    
           EPERM In the case of seteuid (): the calling process is not
                  privileged (does not have the CAP_SETUID capability in its
                  user namespace) and _euid_ does not match the current real
                  user ID, current effective user ID, or current saved set-
                  user-ID.
    
                  In the case of setegid (): the calling process is not
                  privileged (does not have the CAP_SETGID capability in its
                  user namespace) and _egid_ does not match the current real
                  group ID, current effective group ID, or current saved
                  set-group-ID.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Setting the effective user (group) ID to the saved set-user-ID
           (saved set-group-ID) is possible since Linux 1.1.37 (1.1.38).  On
           an arbitrary system one should check _POSIX_SAVED_IDS.
    
           Under glibc 2.0, seteuid( _euid_ ) is equivalent to setreuid(-1,
           _euid_ ) and hence may change the saved set-user-ID.  Under glibc
           2.1 and later, it is equivalent to setresuid(-1, _euid_ , -1) and
           hence does not change the saved set-user-ID.  Analogous remarks
           hold for setegid (), with the difference that the change in
           implementation from setregid(-1, _egid_ ) to setresgid(-1, _egid_ , -1)
           occurred in glibc 2.2 or 2.3 (depending on the hardware
           architecture).
    
           According to POSIX.1, seteuid () ( setegid ()) need not permit _euid_
           ( _egid_ ) to be the same value as the current effective user (group)
           ID, and some implementations do not permit this.
    
       C library/kernel differences
           On Linux, seteuid () and setegid () are implemented as library
           functions that call, respectively, setreuid(2) and setregid(2).

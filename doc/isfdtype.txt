## NAME         top
    
    
           isfdtype - test file type of a file descriptor
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/stat.h>
           #include <sys/socket.h>
    
           int isfdtype(int _fd_ , int _fdtype_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           isfdtype ():
               Since glibc 2.20:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               Before glibc 2.20:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The isfdtype () function tests whether the file descriptor _fd_
           refers to a file of type _fdtype_.  The _fdtype_ argument specifies
           one of the S_IF constants defined in _< sys/stat.h>_ and documented
           in stat(2) (e.g., S_IFREG ).
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The isfdtype () function returns 1 if the file descriptor _fd_ is of
           type _fdtype_ and 0 if it is not.  On failure, -1 is returned and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           The isfdtype () function can fail with any of the same errors as
           fstat(2).
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           The isfdtype () function is not specified in any standard, but did
           appear in the draft POSIX.1g standard.  It is present on OpenBSD
           and Tru64 UNIX (where the required header file in both cases is
           just _< sys/stat.h>_, as shown in the POSIX.1g draft), and possibly
           other systems.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Portable applications should use fstat(2) instead.

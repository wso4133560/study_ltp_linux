    TMPNAM(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              TMPNAM(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           tmpnam, tmpnam_r - create a name for a temporary file
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <stdio.h>
    
           char tmpnam(char  _s_ );
           char tmpnam_r(char  _s_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           tmpnam_r ()
               Since glibc 2.19:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               Up to and including glibc 2.19:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Note: avoid using these functions; use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3)
           instead.
    
           The tmpnam () function returns a pointer to a string that is a
           valid filename, and such that a file with this name did not exist
           at some point in time, so that naive programmers may think it a
           suitable name for a temporary file.  If the argument _s_ is NULL,
           this name is generated in an internal static buffer and may be
           overwritten by the next call to tmpnam ().  If _s_ is not NULL, the
           name is copied to the character array (of length at least
           _L_tmpnam_ ) pointed to by _s_ and the value _s_ is returned in case of
           success.
    
           The created pathname has a directory prefix _P_tmpdir_.  (Both
           _L_tmpnam_ and _P_tmpdir_ are defined in _< stdio.h>_, just like the
           TMP_MAX mentioned below.)
    
           The tmpnam_r () function performs the same task as tmpnam (), but
           returns NULL (to indicate an error) if _s_ is NULL.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           These functions return a pointer to a unique temporary filename,
           or NULL if a unique name cannot be generated.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           No errors are defined.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           tmpnam (): SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008
           marks tmpnam () as obsolete.
    
           tmpnam_r () is a nonstandard extension that is also available on a
           few other systems.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The tmpnam () function generates a different string each time it
           is called, up to TMP_MAX times.  If it is called more than
           TMP_MAX times, the behavior is implementation defined.
    
           Although these functions generate names that are difficult to
           guess, it is nevertheless possible that between the time that the
           pathname is returned and the time that the program opens it,
           another program might create that pathname using open(2), or
           create it as a symbolic link.  This can lead to security holes.
           To avoid such possibilities, use the open(2) O_EXCL flag to open
           the pathname.  Or better yet, use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3).
    
           Portable applications that use threads cannot call tmpnam () with
           a NULL argument if either _POSIX_THREADS or
           _POSIX_THREAD_SAFE_FUNCTIONS is defined.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           Never use these functions.  Use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3) instead.

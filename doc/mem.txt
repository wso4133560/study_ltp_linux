## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           _/dev/mem_ is a character device file that is an image of the main
           memory of the computer.  It may be used, for example, to examine
           (and even patch) the system.
    
           Byte addresses in _/dev/mem_ are interpreted as physical memory
           addresses.  References to nonexistent locations cause errors to
           be returned.
    
           Examining and patching is likely to lead to unexpected results
           when read-only or write-only bits are present.
    
           Since Linux 2.6.26, and depending on the architecture, the
           CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM kernel configuration option limits the areas
           which can be accessed through this file.  For example: on x86,
           RAM access is not allowed but accessing memory-mapped PCI regions
           is.
    
           It is typically created by:
    
               mknod -m 660 /dev/mem c 1 1
               chown root:kmem /dev/mem
    
           The file _/dev/kmem_ is the same as _/dev/mem_ , except that the
           kernel virtual memory rather than physical memory is accessed.
           Since Linux 2.6.26, this file is available only if the
           CONFIG_DEVKMEM kernel configuration option is enabled.
    
           It is typically created by:
    
               mknod -m 640 /dev/kmem c 1 2
               chown root:kmem /dev/kmem
    
           _/dev/port_ is similar to _/dev/mem_ , but the I/O ports are accessed.
    
           It is typically created by:
    
               mknod -m 660 /dev/port c 1 4
               chown root:kmem /dev/port

    MMAP2(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               MMAP2(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           mmap2 - map files or devices into memory
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/mman.h>
    
           void mmap2(unsigned long _addr_ , unsigned long _length_ ,
                       unsigned long _prot_ , unsigned long _flags_ ,
                       unsigned long _fd_ , unsigned long _pgoffset_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This is probably not the system call that you are interested in;
           instead, see mmap(2), which describes the glibc wrapper function
           that invokes this system call.
    
           The mmap2 () system call provides the same interface as mmap(2),
           except that the final argument specifies the offset into the file
           in 4096-byte units (instead of bytes, as is done by mmap(2)).
           This enables applications that use a 32-bit _off_t_ to map large
           files (up to 2^44 bytes).
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, mmap2 () returns a pointer to the mapped area.  On
           error, -1 is returned and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT Problem with getting the data from user space.
    
           EINVAL (Various platforms where the page size is not 4096 bytes.)
                  _offset  4096_ is not a multiple of the system page size.
    
           mmap2 () can also return any of the errors described in mmap(2).
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           mmap2 () is available since Linux 2.3.31.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This system call is Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           On architectures where this system call is present, the glibc
           mmap () wrapper function invokes this system call rather than the
           mmap(2) system call.
    
           This system call does not exist on x86-64.
    
           On ia64, the unit for _offset_ is actually the system page size,
           rather than 4096 bytes.

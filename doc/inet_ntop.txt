    INET_NTOP(3)            Linux Programmer's Manual           INET_NTOP(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           inet_ntop - convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from binary to text
           form
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <arpa/inet.h>
    
           const char inet_ntop(int _af_ , const void restrict _src_ ,
                                 char restrict _dst_ , socklen_t _size_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This function converts the network address structure _src_ in the
           _af_ address family into a character string.  The resulting string
           is copied to the buffer pointed to by _dst_ , which must be a non-
           null pointer.  The caller specifies the number of bytes available
           in this buffer in the argument _size_.
    
           inet_ntop () extends the inet_ntoa(3) function to support multiple
           address families, inet_ntoa(3) is now considered to be deprecated
           in favor of inet_ntop ().  The following address families are
           currently supported:
    
           AF_INET
                  _src_ points to a _struct in_addr_ (in network byte order)
                  which is converted to an IPv4 network address in the
                  dotted-decimal format, " _ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd_ ".  The buffer _dst_
                  must be at least INET_ADDRSTRLEN bytes long.
    
           AF_INET6
                  _src_ points to a _struct in6_addr_ (in network byte order)
                  which is converted to a representation of this address in
                  the most appropriate IPv6 network address format for this
                  address.  The buffer _dst_ must be at least INET6_ADDRSTRLEN
                  bytes long.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, inet_ntop () returns a non-null pointer to _dst_.  NULL
           is returned if there was an error, with _errno_ set to indicate the
           error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EAFNOSUPPORT
                  _af_ was not a valid address family.
    
           ENOSPC The converted address string would exceed the size given
                  by _size_.

           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.  Note that RFC 2553 defines a
           prototype where the last argument _size_ is of type _size_t_.  Many
           systems follow RFC 2553.  Glibc 2.0 and 2.1 have _size_t_ , but 2.2
           and later have _socklen_t_.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           AF_INET6 converts IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses into an IPv6 format.

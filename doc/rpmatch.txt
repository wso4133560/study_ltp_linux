## NAME         top
    
    
           rpmatch - determine if the answer to a question is affirmative or
           negative
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <stdlib.h>
    
           int rpmatch(const char  _response_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           rpmatch ():
               Since glibc 2.19:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
                   _SVID_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           rpmatch () handles a user response to yes or no questions, with
           support for internationalization.
    
           _response_ should be a null-terminated string containing a user-
           supplied response, perhaps obtained with fgets(3) or getline(3).
    
           The user's language preference is taken into account per the
           environment variables LANG , LC_MESSAGES , and LC_ALL , if the
           program has called setlocale(3) to effect their changes.
    
           Regardless of the locale, responses matching ^[Yy] are always
           accepted as affirmative, and those matching ^[Nn] are always
           accepted as negative.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           After examining _response_ , rpmatch () returns 0 for a recognized
           negative response ("no"), 1 for a recognized positive response
           ("yes"), and -1 when the value of _response_ is unrecognized.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           A return value of -1 may indicate either an invalid input, or
           some other error.  It is incorrect to only test if the return
           value is nonzero.
    
           rpmatch () can fail for any of the reasons that regcomp(3) or
           regexec(3) can fail; the cause of the error is not available from
           _errno_ or anywhere else, but indicates a failure of the regex
           engine (but this case is indistinguishable from that of an
           unrecognized value of _response_ ).

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           rpmatch () is not required by any standard, but is available on a
           few other systems.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           The rpmatch () implementation looks at only the first character of
           _response_.  As a consequence, "nyes" returns 0, and "ynever; not
           in a million years" returns 1.  It would be preferable to accept
           input strings much more strictly, for example (using the extended
           regular expression notation described in regex(7)):
           ^([yY]|yes|YES)$ and ^([nN]|no|NO)$.
    
## EXAMPLES         top
    
    
           The following program displays the results when rpmatch () is
           applied to the string given in the program's command-line
           argument.
    
           #define _SVID_SOURCE
           #include <locale.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>
           #include <string.h>
           #include <stdio.h>
    
           int
           main(int argc, char argv[])
           {
               if (argc != 2 || strcmp(argv[1], "--help") == 0) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "%s response\n", argv[0]);
                   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
               }
    
               setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
               printf("rpmatch() returns: %d\n", rpmatch(argv[1]));
               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }

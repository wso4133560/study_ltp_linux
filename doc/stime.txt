## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           NOTE : This function is deprecated; use clock_settime(2) instead.
    
           stime () sets the system's idea of the time and date.  The time,
           pointed to by _t_ , is measured in seconds since the Epoch,
           1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).  stime () may be executed only by
           the superuser.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT Error in getting information from user space.
    
           EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege.  Under
                  Linux, the CAP_SYS_TIME privilege is required.

           pciconfig_read, pciconfig_write, pciconfig_iobase - pci device
           information handling
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <pci.h>
    
           int pciconfig_read(unsigned long _bus_ , unsigned long _dfn_ ,
                              unsigned long _off_ , unsigned long _len_ ,
                              unsigned char  _buf_ );
           int pciconfig_write(unsigned long _bus_ , unsigned long _dfn_ ,
                              unsigned long _off_ , unsigned long _len_ ,
                              unsigned char  _buf_ );
           int pciconfig_iobase(int _which_ , unsigned long _bus_ ,
                              unsigned long _devfn_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Most of the interaction with PCI devices is already handled by
           the kernel PCI layer, and thus these calls should not normally
           need to be accessed from user space.
    
           pciconfig_read ()
                  Reads to _buf_ from device _dev_ at offset _off_ value.
    
           pciconfig_write ()
                  Writes from _buf_ to device _dev_ at offset _off_ value.
    
           pciconfig_iobase ()
                  You pass it a bus/devfn pair and get a physical address
                  for either the memory offset (for things like prep, this
                  is 0xc0000000), the IO base for PIO cycles, or the ISA
                  holes if any.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           pciconfig_read ()
                  On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned
                  and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
           pciconfig_write ()
                  On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned
                  and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
           pciconfig_iobase ()
                  Returns information on locations of various I/O regions in
                  physical memory according to the _which_ value.  Values for
                  _which_ are: IOBASE_BRIDGE_NUMBER , IOBASE_MEMORY , IOBASE_IO ,
                  IOBASE_ISA_IO , IOBASE_ISA_MEM.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL _len_ value is invalid.  This does not apply to
                  pciconfig_iobase ().
    
           EIO I/O error.
    
           ENODEV For pciconfig_iobase (), "hose" value is NULL.  For the
                  other calls, could not find a slot.
    
           ENOSYS The system has not implemented these calls ( CONFIG_PCI not
                  defined).
    
           EOPNOTSUPP
                  This return value is valid only for pciconfig_iobase ().
                  It is returned if the value for _which_ is invalid.
    
           EPERM User does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.  This
                  does not apply to pciconfig_iobase ().
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These calls are Linux-specific, available since Linux
           2.0.26/2.1.11.

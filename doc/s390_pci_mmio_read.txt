## NAME         top
    
    
           s390_pci_mmio_write, s390_pci_mmio_read - transfer data to/from
           PCI MMIO memory page
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <asm/unistd.h>
    
           int s390_pci_mmio_write(unsigned long _mmio_addr_ ,
                                  const void  _user_buffer_ , size_t _length_ );
           int s390_pci_mmio_read(unsigned long _mmio_addr_ ,
                                  void  _user_buffer_ , size_t _length_ );
    
           _Note_ : There are no glibc wrappers for these system calls; see
           NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The s390_pci_mmio_write () system call writes _length_ bytes of data
           from the user-space buffer _user_buffer_ to the PCI MMIO memory
           location specified by _mmio_addr_.  The s390_pci_mmio_read () system
           call reads _length_ bytes of data from the PCI MMIO memory location
           specified by _mmio_addr_ to the user-space buffer _user_buffer_.
    
           These system calls must be used instead of the simple assignment
           or data-transfer operations that are used to access the PCI MMIO
           memory areas mapped to user space on the Linux System z platform.
           The address specified by _mmio_addr_ must belong to a PCI MMIO
           memory page mapping in the caller's address space, and the data
           being written or read must not cross a page boundary.  The _length_
           value cannot be greater than the system page size.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, s390_pci_mmio_write () and s390_pci_mmio_read () return
           0.  On failure, -1 is returned and _errno_ is set to indicate the
           error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT The address in _mmio_addr_ is invalid.
    
           EFAULT _user_buffer_ does not point to a valid location in the
                  caller's address space.
    
           EINVAL Invalid _length_ argument.
    
           ENODEV PCI support is not enabled.
    
           ENOMEM Insufficient memory.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           These system calls are available since Linux 3.19.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This Linux-specific system call is available only on the s390
           architecture.  The required PCI support is available beginning
           with System z EC12.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Glibc does not provide wrappers for these system calls; call them
           using syscall(2)

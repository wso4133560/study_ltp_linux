    SHUTDOWN(2)             Linux Programmer's Manual            SHUTDOWN(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           shutdown - shut down part of a full-duplex connection
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/socket.h>
    
           int shutdown(int _sockfd_ , int _how_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The shutdown () call causes all or part of a full-duplex
           connection on the socket associated with _sockfd_ to be shut down.
           If _how_ is SHUT_RD , further receptions will be disallowed.  If _how_
           is SHUT_WR , further transmissions will be disallowed.  If _how_ is
           SHUT_RDWR , further receptions and transmissions will be
           disallowed.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EBADF _sockfd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           EINVAL An invalid value was specified in _how_ (but see BUGS).
    
           ENOTCONN
                  The specified socket is not connected.
    
           ENOTSOCK
                  The file descriptor _sockfd_ does not refer to a socket.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD ( shutdown () first appeared in
           4.2BSD).
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The constants SHUT_RD , SHUT_WR , SHUT_RDWR have the value 0, 1, 2,
           respectively, and are defined in _< sys/socket.h>_ since
           glibc-2.1.91.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           Checks for the validity of _how_ are done in domain-specific code,
           and before Linux 3.7 not all domains performed these checks.
           Most notably, UNIX domain sockets simply ignored invalid values.
           This problem was fixed for UNIX domain sockets in Linux 3.7.

    GRANTPT(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             GRANTPT(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           grantpt - grant access to the slave pseudoterminal
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <stdlib.h>
    
           int grantpt(int _fd_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           grantpt ():
               Since glibc 2.24:
                   _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
               Glibc 2.23 and earlier:
                   _XOPEN_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The grantpt () function changes the mode and owner of the slave
           pseudoterminal device corresponding to the master pseudoterminal
           referred to by the file descriptor _fd_.  The user ID of the slave
           is set to the real UID of the calling process.  The group ID is
           set to an unspecified value (e.g., _tty_ ).  The mode of the slave
           is set to 0620 (crw--w----).
    
           The behavior of grantpt () is unspecified if a signal handler is
           installed to catch SIGCHLD signals.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           When successful, grantpt () returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns -1
           and sets _errno_ to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EACCES The corresponding slave pseudoterminal could not be
                  accessed.
    
           EBADF The _fd_ argument is not a valid open file descriptor.
    
           EINVAL The _fd_ argument is valid but not associated with a master
                  pseudoterminal.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           grantpt () is provided in glibc since version 2.1.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           This is part of the UNIX 98 pseudoterminal support, see pts(4).
    
           Many systems implement this function via a set-user-ID helper
           binary called "pt_chown".  On Linux systems with a devpts
           filesystem (present since Linux 2.2), the kernel normally sets
           the correct ownership and permissions for the pseudoterminal
           slave when the master is opened (posix_openpt(3)), so that
           nothing must be done by grantpt ().  Thus, no such helper binary
           is required (and indeed it is configured to be absent during the
           glibc build that is typical on many systems).

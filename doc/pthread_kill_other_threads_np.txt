## NAME         top
    
    
           pthread_kill_other_threads_np - terminate all other threads in
           process
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <pthread.h>
    
           void pthread_kill_other_threads_np(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           pthread_kill_other_threads_np () has an effect only in the
           LinuxThreads threading implementation.  On that implementation,
           calling this function causes the immediate termination of all
           threads in the application, except the calling thread.  The
           cancellation state and cancellation type of the to-be-terminated
           threads are ignored, and the cleanup handlers are not called in
           those threads.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This function is a nonstandard GNU extension; hence the suffix
           "_np" (nonportable) in the name.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           pthread_kill_other_threads_np () is intended to be called just
           before a thread calls execve(2) or a similar function.  This
           function is designed to address a limitation in the obsolete
           LinuxThreads implementation whereby the other threads of an
           application are not automatically terminated (as POSIX.1-2001
           requires) during execve(2).
    
           In the NPTL threading implementation,
           pthread_kill_other_threads_np () exists, but does nothing.
           (Nothing needs to be done, because the implementation does the
           right thing during an execve(2).)

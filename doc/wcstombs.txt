    WCSTOMBS(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            WCSTOMBS(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           wcstombs - convert a wide-character string to a multibyte string
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <stdlib.h>
    
           size_t wcstombs(char restrict _dest_ , const wchar_t restrict _src_ ,
                           size_t _n_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           If _dest_ is not NULL, the wcstombs () function converts the wide-
           character string _src_ to a multibyte string starting at _dest_.  At
           most _n_ bytes are written to _dest_.  The sequence of characters
           placed in _dest_ begins in the initial shift state.  The conversion
           can stop for three reasons:
    
           1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be
              represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the current
              locale).  In this case, _(size_t) -1_ is returned.
    
           2. The length limit forces a stop.  In this case, the number of
              bytes written to _dest_ is returned, but the shift state at this
              point is lost.
    
           3. The wide-character string has been completely converted,
              including the terminating null wide character (L'\0').  In
              this case, the conversion ends in the initial shift state.
              The number of bytes written to _dest_ , excluding the terminating
              null byte ('\0'), is returned.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _n_
           bytes at _dest_.
    
           If _dest_ is NULL, _n_ is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as
           above, except that the converted bytes are not written out to
           memory, and no length limit exists.
    
           In order to avoid the case 2 above, the programmer should make
           sure _n_ is greater than or equal to _wcstombs(NULL,src,0)+1_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The wcstombs () function returns the number of bytes that make up
           the converted part of a multibyte sequence, not including the
           terminating null byte.  If a wide character was encountered which
           could not be converted, _(size_t) -1_ is returned.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of wcstombs () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.
    
           The function wcsrtombs(3) provides a better interface to the same
           functionality.

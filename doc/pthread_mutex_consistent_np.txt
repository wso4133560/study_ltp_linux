           pthread_mutex_consistent ():
               _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This function makes a robust mutex consistent if it is in an
           inconsistent state.  A mutex can be left in an inconsistent state
           if its owner terminates while holding the mutex, in which case
           the next owner who acquires the mutex will succeed and be
           notified by a return value of EOWNERDEAD from a call to
           pthread_mutex_lock ().
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, _pthread_mutex_consistent_ () returns 0.  Otherwise, it
           returns a positive error number to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL The mutex is either not robust or is not in an
                  inconsistent state.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           pthread_mutex_consistent () was added to glibc in version 2.12.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2008.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           pthread_mutex_consistent () simply informs the implementation that
           the state (shared data) guarded by the mutex has been restored to
           a consistent state and that normal operations can now be
           performed with the mutex.  It is the application's responsibility
           to ensure that the shared data has been restored to a consistent
           state before calling pthread_mutex_consistent ().
    
           Before the addition of pthread_mutex_consistent () to POSIX, glibc
           defined the following equivalent nonstandard function if
           _GNU_SOURCE was defined:
    
           int pthread_mutex_consistent(const pthread_mutex_t  _mutex_ );
    
           This GNU-specific API, which first appeared in glibc 2.4, is
           nowadays obsolete and should not be used in new programs.

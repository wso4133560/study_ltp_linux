           ttyslot ():
               Since glibc 2.24:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               From glibc 2.20 to 2.23:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
               Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The legacy function ttyslot () returns the index of the current
           user's entry in some file.
    
           Now "What file?" you ask.  Well, let's first look at some
           history.
    
       Ancient history
           There used to be a file _/etc/ttys_ in UNIX V6, that was read by
           the init(1) program to find out what to do with each terminal
           line.  Each line consisted of three characters.  The first
           character was either '0' or '1', where '0' meant "ignore".  The
           second character denoted the terminal: '8' stood for "/dev/tty8".
           The third character was an argument to getty (8) indicating the
           sequence of line speeds to try ('-' was: start trying 110 baud).
           Thus a typical line was "18-".  A hang on some line was solved by
           changing the '1' to a '0', signaling init, changing back again,
           and signaling init again.
    
           In UNIX V7 the format was changed: here the second character was
           the argument to getty (8) indicating the sequence of line speeds
           to try ('0' was: cycle through 300-1200-150-110 baud; '4' was for
           the on-line console DECwriter) while the rest of the line
           contained the name of the tty.  Thus a typical line was
           "14console".
    
           Later systems have more elaborate syntax.  System V-like systems
           have _/etc/inittab_ instead.
    
       Ancient history (2)
           On the other hand, there is the file _/etc/utmp_ listing the people
           currently logged in.  It is maintained by login(1).  It has a
           fixed size, and the appropriate index in the file was determined
           by login(1) using the ttyslot () call to find the number of the
           line in _/etc/ttys_ (counting from 1).
    
       The semantics of ttyslot
           Thus, the function ttyslot () returns the index of the controlling
           terminal of the calling process in the file _/etc/ttys_ , and that
           is (usually) the same as the index of the entry for the current
           user in the file _/etc/utmp_.  BSD still has the _/etc/ttys_ file,
           but System V-like systems do not, and hence cannot refer to it.
           Thus, on such systems the documentation says that ttyslot ()
           returns the current user's index in the user accounting data
           base.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           If successful, this function returns the slot number.  On error
           (e.g., if none of the file descriptors 0, 1, or 2 is associated
           with a terminal that occurs in this data base) it returns 0 on
           UNIX V6 and V7 and BSD-like systems, but -1 on System V-like
           systems.

           requires -1 on error.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The utmp file is found in various places on various systems, such
           as _/etc/utmp_ , _/var/adm/utmp_ , _/var/run/utmp_.
    
           The glibc2 implementation of this function reads the file
           _PATH_TTYS , defined in _< ttyent.h>_ as "/etc/ttys".  It returns 0
           on error.  Since Linux systems do not usually have "/etc/ttys",
           it will always return 0.
    
           On BSD-like systems and Linux, the declaration of ttyslot () is
           provided by _< unistd.h>_.  On System V-like systems, the
           declaration is provided by _< stdlib.h>_.  Since glibc 2.24,
           _< stdlib.h>_ also provides the declaration with the following
           feature test macro definitions:
    
               (_XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 ||
                       (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED))
                   && ! (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600)
    
           Minix also has _fttyslot_ ( _fd_ ).

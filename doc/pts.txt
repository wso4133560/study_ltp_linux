## NAME         top
    
    
           ptmx, pts - pseudoterminal master and slave
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The file _/dev/ptmx_ (the pseudoterminal multiplexor device) is a
           character file with major number 5 and minor number 2, usually
           with mode 0666 and ownership root:root.  It is used to create a
           pseudoterminal master and slave pair.
    
           When a process opens _/dev/ptmx_ , it gets a file descriptor for a
           pseudoterminal master and a pseudoterminal slave device is
           created in the _/dev/pts_ directory.  Each file descriptor obtained
           by opening _/dev/ptmx_ is an independent pseudoterminal master with
           its own associated slave, whose path can be found by passing the
           file descriptor to ptsname(3).
    
           Before opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the
           master's file descriptor to grantpt(3) and unlockpt(3).
    
           Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave
           provides processes with an interface that is identical to that of
           a real terminal.
    
           Data written to the slave is presented on the master file
           descriptor as input.  Data written to the master is presented to
           the slave as input.
    
           In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal
           emulators such as xterm (1), in which data read from the
           pseudoterminal master is interpreted by the application in the
           same way a real terminal would interpret the data, and for
           implementing remote-login programs such as sshd(8), in which data
           read from the pseudoterminal master is sent across the network to
           a client program that is connected to a terminal or terminal
           emulator.
    
           Pseudoterminals can also be used to send input to programs that
           normally refuse to read input from pipes (such as su(1), and
           passwd(1)).

## NOTES         top
    
    
           The Linux support for the above (known as UNIX 98 pseudoterminal
           naming) is done using the _devpts_ filesystem, which should be
           mounted on _/dev/pts_.

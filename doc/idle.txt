## NAME         top
    
    
           idle - make process 0 idle
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int idle(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           idle () is an internal system call used during bootstrap.  It
           marks the process's pages as swappable, lowers its priority, and
           enters the main scheduling loop.  idle () never returns.
    
           Only process 0 may call idle ().  Any user process, even a process
           with superuser permission, will receive EPERM.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           idle () never returns for process 0, and always returns -1 for a
           user process.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EPERM Always, for a user process.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           Since Linux 2.3.13, this system call does not exist anymore.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This function is Linux-specific, and should not be used in
           programs intended to be portable.

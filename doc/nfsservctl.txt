## NAME         top
    
    
           nfsservctl - syscall interface to kernel nfs daemon
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <linux/nfsd/syscall.h>
    
           long nfsservctl(int _cmd_ , struct nfsctl_arg  _argp_ ,
                           union nfsctl_res  _resp_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           _Note_ : Since Linux 3.1, this system call no longer exists.  It has
           been replaced by a set of files in the _nfsd_ filesystem; see
           nfsd(7).
    
               /
                 These are the commands understood by nfsctl().
                /
               #define NFSCTL_SVC        0  / This is a server process. /
               #define NFSCTL_ADDCLIENT  1  / Add an NFS client. /
               #define NFSCTL_DELCLIENT  2  / Remove an NFS client. /
               #define NFSCTL_EXPORT     3  / Export a filesystem. /
               #define NFSCTL_UNEXPORT   4  / Unexport a filesystem. /
               #define NFSCTL_UGIDUPDATE 5  / Update a client's UID/GID map
                                               (only in Linux 2.4.x and earlier). /
               #define NFSCTL_GETFH      6  / Get a file handle (used by mountd)
                                               (only in Linux 2.4.x and earlier). /

                   int                       ca_version;     / safeguard /
                   union {
                       struct nfsctl_svc     u_svc;

                       struct knfs_fh          cr_getfh;
                       unsigned int            cr_debug;
               };
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           This system call was removed from the Linux kernel in version
           3.1.  Library support was removed from glibc in version 2.28.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This call is Linux-specific.

    VMSPLICE(2)             Linux Programmer's Manual            VMSPLICE(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           vmsplice - splice user pages to/from a pipe
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #define _GNU_SOURCE / See feature_test_macros(7) /
           #include <fcntl.h>
           #include <sys/uio.h>
    
           ssize_t vmsplice(int _fd_ , const struct iovec  _iov_ ,
                            size_t _nr_segs_ , unsigned int _flags_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           If _fd_ is opened for writing, the vmsplice () system call maps
           _nr_segs_ ranges of user memory described by _iov_ into a pipe.  If
           _fd_ is opened for reading, the vmsplice () system call fills
           _nr_segs_ ranges of user memory described by _iov_ from a pipe.  The
           file descriptor _fd_ must refer to a pipe.
    
           The pointer _iov_ points to an array of _iovec_ structures as defined
           in _< sys/uio.h>_:
    
               struct iovec {
                   void  iov_base;        / Starting address /
                   size_t iov_len;         / Number of bytes /
               };
    
           The _flags_ argument is a bit mask that is composed by ORing
           together zero or more of the following values:
    
           SPLICE_F_MOVE
                  Unused for vmsplice (); see splice(2).
    
           SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK
                  Do not block on I/O; see splice(2) for further details.
    
           SPLICE_F_MORE
                  Currently has no effect for vmsplice (), but may be
                  implemented in the future; see splice(2).
    
           SPLICE_F_GIFT
                  The user pages are a gift to the kernel.  The application
                  may not modify this memory ever, otherwise the page cache
                  and on-disk data may differ.  Gifting pages to the kernel
                  means that a subsequent splice(2) SPLICE_F_MOVE can
                  successfully move the pages; if this flag is not
                  specified, then a subsequent splice(2) SPLICE_F_MOVE must
                  copy the pages.  Data must also be properly page aligned,
                  both in memory and length.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           Upon successful completion, vmsplice () returns the number of
           bytes transferred to the pipe.  On error, vmsplice () returns -1
           and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EAGAIN SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK was specified in _flags_ , and the
                  operation would block.
    
           EBADF _fd_ either not valid, or doesn't refer to a pipe.
    
           EINVAL _nr_segs_ is greater than IOV_MAX ; or memory not aligned if
                  SPLICE_F_GIFT set.
    
           ENOMEM Out of memory.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The vmsplice () system call first appeared in Linux 2.6.17;
           library support was added to glibc in version 2.5.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This system call is Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           vmsplice () follows the other vectorized read/write type functions
           when it comes to limitations on the number of segments being
           passed in.  This limit is IOV_MAX as defined in _< limits.h>_.
           Currently, this limit is 1024.
    
           vmsplice () really supports true splicing only from user memory to
           a pipe.  In the opposite direction, it actually just copies the
           data to user space.  But this makes the interface nice and
           symmetric and enables people to build on vmsplice () with room for
           future improvement in performance.

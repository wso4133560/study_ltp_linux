## NAME         top
    
    
           futimes, lutimes - change file timestamps
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/time.h>
    
           int futimes(int _fd_ , const struct timeval _tv_ [2]);
           int lutimes(const char  _filename_ , const struct timeval _tv_ [2]);
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           futimes (), lutimes ():
               Since glibc 2.19:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
                   _BSD_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           futimes () changes the access and modification times of a file in
           the same way as utimes(2), with the difference that the file
           whose timestamps are to be changed is specified via a file
           descriptor, _fd_ , rather than via a pathname.
    
           lutimes () changes the access and modification times of a file in
           the same way as utimes(2), with the difference that if _filename_
           refers to a symbolic link, then the link is not dereferenced:
           instead, the timestamps of the symbolic link are changed.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           Errors are as for utimes(2), with the following additions for
           futimes ():
    
           EBADF _fd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           ENOSYS The _/proc_ filesystem could not be accessed.
    
           The following additional error may occur for lutimes ():
    
           ENOSYS The kernel does not support this call; Linux 2.6.22 or
                  later is required.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           futimes () is available since glibc 2.3.  lutimes () is available
           since glibc 2.6, and is implemented using the utimensat(2) system
           call, which is supported since kernel 2.6.22.

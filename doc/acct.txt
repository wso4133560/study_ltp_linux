## NAME         top
    
    
           acct - process accounting file
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/acct.h>
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           If the kernel is built with the process accounting option enabled
           ( CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT ), then calling acct(2) starts process
           accounting, for example:
    
               acct("/var/log/pacct");
    
           When process accounting is enabled, the kernel writes a record to
           the accounting file as each process on the system terminates.
           This record contains information about the terminated process,
           and is defined in _< sys/acct.h>_ as follows:
    
               #define ACCT_COMM 16
    
               typedef u_int16_t comp_t;
    
               struct acct {
                   char ac_flag;           / Accounting flags /
                   u_int16_t ac_uid;       / Accounting user ID /
                   u_int16_t ac_gid;       / Accounting group ID /
                   u_int16_t ac_tty;       / Controlling terminal /
                   u_int32_t ac_btime;     / Process creation time
                                              (seconds since the Epoch) /
                   comp_t    ac_utime;     / User CPU time /
                   comp_t    ac_stime;     / System CPU time /
                   comp_t    ac_etime;     / Elapsed time /
                   comp_t    ac_mem;       / Average memory usage (kB) /
                   comp_t    ac_io;        / Characters transferred (unused) /
                   comp_t    ac_rw;        / Blocks read or written (unused) /
                   comp_t    ac_minflt;    / Minor page faults /
                   comp_t    ac_majflt;    / Major page faults /
                   comp_t    ac_swaps;     / Number of swaps (unused) /
                   u_int32_t ac_exitcode;  / Process termination status
                                              (see wait(2)) /
                   char      ac_comm[ACCT_COMM+1];
                                           / Command name (basename of last
                                              executed command; null-terminated) /
                   char      ac_pad[ _X_ ];    / padding bytes /
               };
    
               enum {          / Bits that may be set in ac_flag field /
                   AFORK = 0x01,           / Has executed fork, but no exec /
                   ASU   = 0x02,           / Used superuser privileges /
                   ACORE = 0x08,           / Dumped core /
                   AXSIG = 0x10            / Killed by a signal /
               };
    
           The _comp_t_ data type is a floating-point value consisting of a
           3-bit, base-8 exponent, and a 13-bit mantissa.  A value, _c_ , of
           this type can be converted to a (long) integer as follows:
    
               v = (c & 0x1fff) << (((c >> 13) & 0x7)  3);
    
           The _ac_utime_ , _ac_stime_ , and _ac_etime_ fields measure time in
           "clock ticks"; divide these values by _sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)_ to
           convert them to seconds.
    
       Version 3 accounting file format
           Since kernel 2.6.8, an optional alternative version of the
           accounting file can be produced if the CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT_V3
           option is set when building the kernel.  With this option is set,
           the records written to the accounting file contain additional
           fields, and the width of _c_uid_ and _ac_gid_ fields is widened from
           16 to 32 bits (in line with the increased size of UID and GIDs in
           Linux 2.4 and later).  The records are defined as follows:
    
               struct acct_v3 {
                   char      ac_flag;      / Flags /
                   char      ac_version;   / Always set to ACCT_VERSION (3) /
                   u_int16_t ac_tty;       / Controlling terminal /
                   u_int32_t ac_exitcode;  / Process termination status /
                   u_int32_t ac_uid;       / Real user ID /
                   u_int32_t ac_gid;       / Real group ID /
                   u_int32_t ac_pid;       / Process ID /
                   u_int32_t ac_ppid;      / Parent process ID /
                   u_int32_t ac_btime;     / Process creation time /
                   float     ac_etime;     / Elapsed time /
                   comp_t    ac_utime;     / User CPU time /
                   comp_t    ac_stime;     / System time /
                   comp_t    ac_mem;       / Average memory usage (kB) /
                   comp_t    ac_io;        / Characters transferred (unused) /
                   comp_t    ac_rw;        / Blocks read or written
                                              (unused) /
                   comp_t    ac_minflt;    / Minor page faults /
                   comp_t    ac_majflt;    / Major page faults /
                   comp_t    ac_swaps;     / Number of swaps (unused) /
                   char      ac_comm[ACCT_COMM]; / Command name /
               };
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The _acct_v3_ structure is defined in glibc since version 2.6.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           Process accounting originated on BSD.  Although it is present on
           most systems, it is not standardized, and the details vary
           somewhat between systems.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Records in the accounting file are ordered by termination time of
           the process.
    
           In kernels up to and including 2.6.9, a separate accounting
           record is written for each thread created using the NPTL
           threading library; since Linux 2.6.10, a single accounting record
           is written for the entire process on termination of the last
           thread in the process.
    
           The _/proc/sys/kernel/acct_ file, described in proc(5), defines
           settings that control the behavior of process accounting when
           disk space runs low.

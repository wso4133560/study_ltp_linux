## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Section 8 of the manual describes commands which either can be or
           are used only by the superuser, like system-administration
           commands, daemons, and hardware-related commands.
    
           As with the commands described in Section 1, the commands
           described in this section terminate with an exit status that
           indicates whether the command succeeded or failed.  See intro(1)
           for more information.

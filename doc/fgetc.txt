    FGETC(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               FGETC(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           fgetc, fgets, getc, getchar, ungetc - input of characters and
           strings
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <stdio.h>
    
           int fgetc(FILE  _stream_ );
           int getc(FILE  _stream_ );
           int getchar(void);
    
           char fgets(char restrict _s_ , int _size_ , FILE restrict _stream_ );
    
           int ungetc(int _c_ , FILE  _stream_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           fgetc () reads the next character from _stream_ and returns it as an
           _unsigned char_ cast to an _int_ , or EOF on end of file or error.
    
           getc () is equivalent to fgetc () except that it may be implemented
           as a macro which evaluates _stream_ more than once.
    
           getchar () is equivalent to getc( _stdin_ ).
    
           fgets () reads in at most one less than _size_ characters from
           _stream_ and stores them into the buffer pointed to by _s_.  Reading
           stops after an EOF or a newline.  If a newline is read, it is
           stored into the buffer.  A terminating null byte ('\0') is stored
           after the last character in the buffer.
    
           ungetc () pushes _c_ back to _stream_ , cast to _unsigned char_ , where it
           is available for subsequent read operations.  Pushed-back
           characters will be returned in reverse order; only one pushback
           is guaranteed.
    
           Calls to the functions described here can be mixed with each
           other and with calls to other input functions from the _stdio_
           library for the same input stream.
    
           For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           fgetc (), getc (), and getchar () return the character read as an
           _unsigned char_ cast to an _int_ or EOF on end of file or error.
    
           fgets () returns _s_ on success, and NULL on error or when end of
           file occurs while no characters have been read.
    
           ungetc () returns _c_ on success, or EOF on error.

           It is not advisable to mix calls to input functions from the
           _stdio_ library with low-level calls to read(2) for the file
           descriptor associated with the input stream; the results will be
           undefined and very probably not what you want.

    ICONV_OPEN(3)           Linux Programmer's Manual          ICONV_OPEN(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           iconv_open - allocate descriptor for character set conversion
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <iconv.h>
    
           iconv_t iconv_open(const char  _tocode_ , const char  _fromcode_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The iconv_open () function allocates a conversion descriptor
           suitable for converting byte sequences from character encoding
           _fromcode_ to character encoding _tocode_.
    
           The values permitted for _fromcode_ and _tocode_ and the supported
           combinations are system-dependent.  For the GNU C library, the
           permitted values are listed by the _iconv --list_ command, and all
           combinations of the listed values are supported.  Furthermore the
           GNU C library and the GNU libiconv library support the following
           two suffixes:
    
           //TRANSLIT
                  When the string "//TRANSLIT" is appended to _tocode_ ,
                  transliteration is activated.  This means that when a
                  character cannot be represented in the target character
                  set, it can be approximated through one or several
                  similarly looking characters.
    
           //IGNORE
                  When the string "//IGNORE" is appended to _tocode_ ,
                  characters that cannot be represented in the target
                  character set will be silently discarded.
    
           The resulting conversion descriptor can be used with iconv(3) any
           number of times.  It remains valid until deallocated using
           iconv_close(3).
    
           A conversion descriptor contains a conversion state.  After
           creation using iconv_open (), the state is in the initial state.
           Using iconv(3) modifies the descriptor's conversion state.  To
           bring the state back to the initial state, use iconv(3) with NULL
           as _inbuf_ argument.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, iconv_open () returns a freshly allocated conversion
           descriptor.  On failure, it returns _(iconv_t) -1_ and sets _errno_
           to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           The following error can occur, among others:
    
           EINVAL The conversion from _fromcode_ to _tocode_ is not supported by
                  the implementation.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           This function is available in glibc since version 2.1.

## NAME         top
    
    
           iswpunct - test for punctuation or symbolic wide character
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wctype.h>
    
           int iswpunct(wint_t _wc_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The iswpunct () function is the wide-character equivalent of the
           ispunct(3) function.  It tests whether _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "punct".
    
           The wide-character class "punct" is a subclass of the wide-
           character class "graph", and therefore also a subclass of the
           wide-character class "print".
    
           The wide-character class "punct" is disjoint from the wide-
           character class "alnum" and therefore also disjoint from its
           subclasses "alpha", "upper", "lower", "digit", "xdigit".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
           character class "punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "cntrl".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
           character class "punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "space" and its subclass "blank".
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The iswpunct () function returns nonzero if _wc_ is a wide-character
           belonging to the wide-character class "punct".  Otherwise, it
           returns zero.

           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of iswpunct () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.
    
           This function's name is a misnomer when dealing with Unicode
           characters, because the wide-character class "punct" contains
           both punctuation characters and symbol (math, currency, etc.)
           characters.

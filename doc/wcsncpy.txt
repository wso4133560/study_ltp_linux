## NAME         top
    
    
           wcsncpy - copy a fixed-size string of wide characters
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           wchar_t wcsncpy(wchar_t restrict _dest_ , const wchar_t restrict _src_ ,
                            size_t _n_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The wcsncpy () function is the wide-character equivalent of the
           strncpy(3) function.  It copies at most _n_ wide characters from
           the wide-character string pointed to by _src_ , including the
           terminating null wide character (L'\0'), to the array pointed to
           by _dest_.  Exactly _n_ wide characters are written at _dest_.  If the
           length _wcslen(src)_ is smaller than _n_ , the remaining wide
           characters in the array pointed to by _dest_ are filled with null
           wide characters.  If the length _wcslen(src)_ is greater than or
           equal to _n_ , the string pointed to by _dest_ will not be terminated
           by a null wide character.
    
           The strings may not overlap.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _n_ wide
           characters at _dest_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           wcsncpy () returns _dest_.

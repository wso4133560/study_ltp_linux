## NAME         top
    
    
           localedef - compile locale definition files
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           localedef [ _options_ ] _outputpath_
           localedef --add-to-archive [ _options_ ] _compiledpath_
           localedef --delete-from-archive [ _options_ ] _localename_ ...
           localedef --list-archive [ _options_ ]
           localedef --help
           localedef --usage
           localedef --version
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The localedef program reads the indicated _charmap_ and _input_
           files, compiles them to a binary form quickly usable by the
           locale functions in the C library (setlocale(3), localeconv(3),
           etc.), and places the output in _outputpath_.
    
           The _outputpath_ argument is interpreted as follows:
    
             If _outputpath_ contains a slash character ('/'), it is
              interpreted as the name of the directory where the output
              definitions are to be stored.  In this case, there is a
              separate output file for each locale category ( _LC_TIME_ ,
              _LC_NUMERIC_ , and so on).
    
             If the --no-archive option is used, _outputpath_ is the name of
              a subdirectory in _/usr/lib/locale_ where per-category compiled
              files are placed.
    
             Otherwise, _outputpath_ is the name of a locale and the compiled
              locale data is added to the archive file
              _/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive_.  A locale archive is a memory-
              mapped file which contains all the system-provided locales; it
              is used by all localized programs when the environment
              variable LOCPATH is not set.
    
           In any case, localedef aborts if the directory in which it tries
           to write locale files has not already been created.
    
           If no _charmapfile_ is given, the value _ANSI_X3.4-1968_ (for ASCII)
           is used by default.  If no _inputfile_ is given, or if it is given
           as a dash (-), localedef reads from standard input.
    
## OPTIONS         top
    
    
       Operation-selection options
           A few options direct localedef to do something other than compile
           locale definitions.  Only one of these options should be used at
           a time.
    
           --add-to-archive
                  Add the _compiledpath_ directories to the locale archive
                  file.  The directories should have been created by
                  previous runs of localedef , using --no-archive.
    
           --delete-from-archive
                  Delete the named locales from the locale archive file.
    
           --list-archive
                  List the locales contained in the locale archive file.
    
       Other options
           Some of the following options are sensible only for certain
           operations; generally, it should be self-evident which ones.
           Notice that -f and -c are reversed from what you might expect;
           that is, -f is not the same as --force.
    
           -f _charmapfile_ , --charmap= _charmapfile_
                  Specify the file that defines the character set that is
                  used by the input file.  If _charmapfile_ contains a slash
                  character ('/'), it is interpreted as the name of the
                  character map.  Otherwise, the file is sought in the
                  current directory and the default directory for character
                  maps.  If the environment variable I18NPATH is set,
                  _$I18NPATH/charmaps/_ and _$I18NPATH/_ are also searched after
                  the current directory.  The default directory for
                  character maps is printed by localedef --help.
    
           -i _inputfile_ , --inputfile= _inputfile_
                  Specify the locale definition file to compile.  The file
                  is sought in the current directory and the default
                  directory for locale definition files.  If the environment
                  variable I18NPATH is set, _$I18NPATH/locales/_ and _$I18NPATH_
                  are also searched after the current directory.  The
                  default directory for locale definition files is printed
                  by localedef --help.
    
           -u _repertoirefile_ , --repertoire-map= _repertoirefile_
                  Read mappings from symbolic names to Unicode code points
                  from _repertoirefile_.  If _repertoirefile_ contains a slash
                  character ('/'), it is interpreted as the pathname of the
                  repertoire map.  Otherwise, the file is sought in the
                  current directory and the default directory for repertoire
                  maps.  If the environment variable I18NPATH is set,
                  _$I18NPATH/repertoiremaps/_ and _$I18NPATH_ are also searched
                  after the current directory.  The default directory for
                  repertoire maps is printed by localedef --help.
    
           -A _aliasfile_ , --alias-file= _aliasfile_
                  Use _aliasfile_ to look up aliases for locale names.  There
                  is no default aliases file.
    
           -c , --force
                  Write the output files even if warnings were generated
                  about the input file.
    
           -v , --verbose
                  Generate extra warnings about errors that are normally
                  ignored.
    
           --big-endian
                  Generate big-endian output.
    
           --little-endian
                  Generate little-endian output.
    
           --no-archive
                  Do not use the locale archive file, instead create
                  _outputpath_ as a subdirectory in the same directory as the
                  locale archive file, and create separate output files for
                  locale categories in it.  This is helpful to prevent
                  system locale archive updates from overwriting custom
                  locales created with localedef.
    
           --no-hard-links
                  Do not create hard links between installed locales.
    
           --no-warnings= _warnings_
                  Comma-separated list of warnings to disable.  Supported
                  warnings are _ascii_ and _intcurrsym_.
    
           --posix
                  Conform strictly to POSIX.  Implies --verbose.  This
                  option currently has no other effect.  POSIX conformance
                  is assumed if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is
                  set.
    
           --prefix= _pathname_
                  Set the prefix to be prepended to the full archive
                  pathname.  By default, the prefix is empty.  Setting the
                  prefix to _foo_ , the archive would be placed in
                  _foo/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive_.
    
           --quiet
                  Suppress all notifications and warnings, and report only
                  fatal errors.
    
           --replace
                  Replace a locale in the locale archive file.  Without this
                  option, if the locale is in the archive file already, an
                  error occurs.
    
           --warnings= _warnings_
                  Comma-separated list of warnings to enable.  Supported
                  warnings are _ascii_ and _intcurrsym_.
    
           -? , --help
                  Print a usage summary and exit.  Also prints the default
                  paths used by localedef.
    
           --usage
                  Print a short usage summary and exit.
    
           -V , --version
                  Print the version number, license, and disclaimer of
                  warranty for localedef.
    
## EXIT STATUS         top
    
    
           One of the following exit values can be returned by localedef :
    
           0 Command completed successfully.
    
           1 Warnings or errors occurred, output files were written.
    
           4 Errors encountered, no output created.
    
## ENVIRONMENT         top
    
    
           POSIXLY_CORRECT
                  The --posix flag is assumed if this environment variable
                  is set.
    
           I18NPATH
                  A colon-separated list of search directories for files.
    
## FILES         top

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2008.
    
## EXAMPLES         top
    
    
           Compile the locale files for Finnish in the UTF-8 character set
           and add it to the default locale archive with the name
           fi_FI.UTF-8 :
    
               localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_FI fi_FI.UTF-8
    
           The next example does the same thing, but generates files into
           the _fi_FI.UTF-8_ directory which can then be used by programs when
           the environment variable LOCPATH is set to the current directory
           (note that the last argument must contain a slash):
    
               localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_FI ./fi_FI.UTF-8

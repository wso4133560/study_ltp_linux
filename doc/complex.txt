## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Complex numbers are numbers of the form z = a+bi, where a and b
           are real numbers and i = sqrt(-1), so that ii = -1.
    
           There are other ways to represent that number.  The pair (a,b) of
           real numbers may be viewed as a point in the plane, given by X-
           and Y-coordinates.  This same point may also be described by
           giving the pair of real numbers (r,phi), where r is the distance
           to the origin O, and phi the angle between the X-axis and the
           line Oz.  Now z = rexp(iphi) = r(cos(phi)+isin(phi)).
    
           The basic operations are defined on z = a+bi and w = c+di as:
    
           addition: z+w = (a+c) + (b+d)i
    
           multiplication: zw = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
    
           division: z/w = ((ac + bd)/(cc + dd)) + ((bc - ad)/(cc +
           dd))i
    
           Nearly all math function have a complex counterpart but there are
           some complex-only functions.
    
## EXAMPLES         top
    
    
           Your C-compiler can work with complex numbers if it supports the
           C99 standard.  Link with _-lm_.  The imaginary unit is represented
           by I.

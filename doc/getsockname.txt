## NAME         top
    
    
           getsockname - get socket name
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/socket.h>
    
           int getsockname(int _sockfd_ , struct sockaddr restrict _addr_ ,
                           socklen_t restrict _addrlen_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           getsockname () returns the current address to which the socket
           _sockfd_ is bound, in the buffer pointed to by _addr_.  The _addrlen_
           argument should be initialized to indicate the amount of space
           (in bytes) pointed to by _addr_.  On return it contains the actual
           size of the socket address.
    
           The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too
           small; in this case, _addrlen_ will return a value greater than was
           supplied to the call.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EBADF The argument _sockfd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           EFAULT The _addr_ argument points to memory not in a valid part of
                  the process address space.
    
           EINVAL _addrlen_ is invalid (e.g., is negative).
    
           ENOBUFS
                  Insufficient resources were available in the system to
                  perform the operation.
    
           ENOTSOCK
                  The file descriptor _sockfd_ does not refer to a socket.

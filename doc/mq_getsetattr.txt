## NAME         top
    
    
           mq_getsetattr - get/set message queue attributes
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <mqueue.h>
    
           int mq_getsetattr(mqd_t _mqdes_ , const struct mq_attr  _newattr_ ,
                            struct mq_attr  _oldattr_ );
    
           _Note_ : There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Do not use this system call.
    
           This is the low-level system call used to implement mq_getattr(3)
           and mq_setattr(3).  For an explanation of how this system call
           operates, see the description of mq_setattr(3).
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This interface is nonstandard; avoid its use.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; call it
           using syscall(2).  (Actually, never call it unless you are
           writing a C library!)

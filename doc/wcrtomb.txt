    WCRTOMB(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             WCRTOMB(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           wcrtomb - convert a wide character to a multibyte sequence
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           size_t wcrtomb(char restrict _s_ , wchar_t _wc_ , mbstate_t restrict _ps_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The main case for this function is when _s_ is not NULL and _wc_ is
           not a null wide character (L'\0').  In this case, the wcrtomb ()
           function converts the wide character _wc_ to its multibyte
           representation and stores it at the beginning of the character
           array pointed to by _s_.  It updates the shift state _ps_ , and
           returns the length of said multibyte representation, that is, the
           number of bytes written at _s_.
    
           A different case is when _s_ is not NULL, but _wc_ is a null wide
           character (L'\0').  In this case, the wcrtomb () function stores
           at the character array pointed to by _s_ the shift sequence needed
           to bring _ps_ back to the initial state, followed by a '\0' byte.
           It updates the shift state _ps_ (i.e., brings it into the initial
           state), and returns the length of the shift sequence plus one,
           that is, the number of bytes written at _s_.
    
           A third case is when _s_ is NULL.  In this case, _wc_ is ignored, and
           the function effectively returns
    
               wcrtomb(buf, L'\0', ps)
    
           where _buf_ is an internal anonymous buffer.
    
           In all of the above cases, if _ps_ is NULL, a static anonymous
           state known only to the wcrtomb () function is used instead.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The wcrtomb () function returns the number of bytes that have been
           or would have been written to the byte array at _s_.  If _wc_ can not
           be represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the current
           locale), _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and _errno_ set to EILSEQ.

           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of wcrtomb () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
           current locale.
    
           Passing NULL as _ps_ is not multithread safe.

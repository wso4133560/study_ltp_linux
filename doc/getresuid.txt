    GETRESUID(2)            Linux Programmer's Manual           GETRESUID(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           getresuid, getresgid - get real, effective, and saved user/group
           IDs
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #define _GNU_SOURCE / See feature_test_macros(7) /
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int getresuid(uid_t  _ruid_ , uid_t  _euid_ , uid_t  _suid_ );
           int getresgid(gid_t  _rgid_ , gid_t  _egid_ , gid_t  _sgid_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           getresuid () returns the real UID, the effective UID, and the
           saved set-user-ID of the calling process, in the arguments _ruid_ ,
           _euid_ , and _suid_ , respectively.  getresgid () performs the analogous
           task for the process's group IDs.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT One of the arguments specified an address outside the
                  calling program's address space.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           These system calls appeared on Linux starting with kernel 2.1.44.
    
           The prototypes are given by glibc since version 2.3.2, provided
           _GNU_SOURCE is defined.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These calls are nonstandard; they also appear on HP-UX and some
           of the BSDs.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The original Linux getresuid () and getresgid () system calls
           supported only 16-bit user and group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux
           2.4 added getresuid32 () and getresgid32 (), supporting 32-bit IDs.
           The glibc getresuid () and getresgid () wrapper functions
           transparently deal with the variations across kernel versions.

## NAME         top
    
    
           atan2, atan2f, atan2l - arc tangent function of two variables
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <math.h>
    
           double atan2(double _y_ , double _x_ );
           float atan2f(float _y_ , float _x_ );
           long double atan2l(long double _y_ , long double _x_ );

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These functions calculate the principal value of the arc tangent
           of _y/x_ , using the signs of the two arguments to determine the
           quadrant of the result.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, these functions return the principal value of the arc
           tangent of _y/x_ in radians; the return value is in the range
           [-pi, pi].
    
           If _y_ is +0 (-0) and _x_ is less than 0, +pi (-pi) is returned.
    
           If _y_ is +0 (-0) and _x_ is greater than 0, +0 (-0) is returned.
    
           If _y_ is less than 0 and _x_ is +0 or -0, -pi/2 is returned.
    
           If _y_ is greater than 0 and _x_ is +0 or -0, pi/2 is returned.
    
           If either _x_ or _y_ is NaN, a NaN is returned.
    
           If _y_ is +0 (-0) and _x_ is -0, +pi (-pi) is returned.
    
           If _y_ is +0 (-0) and _x_ is +0, +0 (-0) is returned.
    
           If _y_ is a finite value greater (less) than 0, and _x_ is negative
           infinity, +pi (-pi) is returned.
    
           If _y_ is a finite value greater (less) than 0, and _x_ is positive
           infinity, +0 (-0) is returned.
    
           If _y_ is positive infinity (negative infinity), and _x_ is finite,
           pi/2 (-pi/2) is returned.
    
           If _y_ is positive infinity (negative infinity) and _x_ is negative
           infinity, +3pi/4 (-3pi/4) is returned.
    
           If _y_ is positive infinity (negative infinity) and _x_ is positive
           infinity, +pi/4 (-pi/4) is returned.

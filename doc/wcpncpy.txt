## NAME         top
    
    
           wcpncpy - copy a fixed-size string of wide characters, returning
           a pointer to its end
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           wchar_t wcpncpy(wchar_t restrict _dest_ , const wchar_t restrict _src_ ,
                            size_t _n_ );

           wcpncpy ():
               Since glibc 2.10:
                   _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
               Before glibc 2.10:

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The wcpncpy () function is the wide-character equivalent of the
           stpncpy(3) function.  It copies at most _n_ wide characters from
           the wide-character string pointed to by _src_ , including the
           terminating null wide (L'\0'), to the array pointed to by _dest_.
           Exactly _n_ wide characters are written at _dest_.  If the length
           _wcslen(src)_ is smaller than _n_ , the remaining wide characters in
           the array pointed to by _dest_ are filled with L'\0' characters.
           If the length _wcslen(src)_ is greater than or equal to _n_ , the
           string pointed to by _dest_ will not be L'\0' terminated.
    
           The strings may not overlap.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _n_ wide
           characters at _dest_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           wcpncpy () returns a pointer to the last wide character written,
           that is, _dest_ + _n_ -1.

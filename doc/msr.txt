## NAME         top
    
    
           msr - x86 CPU MSR access device
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           _/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr_ provides an interface to read and write the
           model-specific registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU.  _CPUNUM_ is the
           number of the CPU to access as listed in _/proc/cpuinfo_.
    
           The register access is done by opening the file and seeking to
           the MSR number as offset in the file, and then reading or writing
           in chunks of 8 bytes.  An I/O transfer of more than 8 bytes means
           multiple reads or writes of the same register.
    
           This file is protected so that it can be read and written only by
           the user _root_ , or members of the group _root_.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The _msr_ driver is not auto-loaded.  On modular kernels you might
           need to use the following command to load it explicitly before
           use:
    
               $ modprobe msr

           int ecb_crypt(char  _key_ , char  _data_ , unsigned int _datalen_ ,
                         unsigned int _mode_ );
           int cbc_crypt(char  _key_ , char  _data_ , unsigned int _datalen_ ,

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           ecb_crypt () and cbc_crypt () implement the NBS DES (Data
           Encryption Standard).  These routines are faster and more general
           purpose than crypt(3).  They also are able to utilize DES
           hardware if it is available.  ecb_crypt () encrypts in ECB
           (Electronic Code Book) mode, which encrypts blocks of data
           independently.  cbc_crypt () encrypts in CBC (Cipher Block
           Chaining) mode, which chains together successive blocks.  CBC
           mode protects against insertions, deletions, and substitutions of
           blocks.  Also, regularities in the clear text will not appear in
           the cipher text.
    
           Here is how to use these routines.  The first argument, _key_ , is
           the 8-byte encryption key with parity.  To set the key's parity,
           which for DES is in the low bit of each byte, use
           des_setparity ().  The second argument, _data_ , contains the data to
           be encrypted or decrypted.  The third argument, _datalen_ , is the
           length in bytes of _data_ , which must be a multiple of 8.  The
           fourth argument, _mode_ , is formed by ORing together some things.
           For the encryption direction OR in either DES_ENCRYPT or
           DES_DECRYPT.  For software versus hardware encryption, OR in
           either DES_HW or DES_SW.  If DES_HW is specified, and there is no
           hardware, then the encryption is performed in software and the
           routine returns DESERR_NOHWDEVICE.  For cbc_crypt (), the argument
           _ivec_ is the 8-byte initialization vector for the chaining.  It is
           updated to the next initialization vector upon return.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           DESERR_NONE
                  No error.
    
           DESERR_NOHWDEVICE
                  Encryption succeeded, but done in software instead of the
                  requested hardware.
    
           DESERR_HWERROR
                  An error occurred in the hardware or driver.
    
           DESERR_BADPARAM
                  Bad argument to routine.
    
           Given a result status _stat_ , the macro DES_FAILED( _stat_ ) is false
           only for the first two statuses.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           These functions were added to glibc in version 2.1.
    
           Because they employ the DES block cipher, which is no longer
           considered secure, ecb_crypt (), ecb_crypt (), crypt_r (), and
           des_setparity () were removed in glibc 2.28.  Applications should
           switch to a modern cryptography library, such as libgcrypt.

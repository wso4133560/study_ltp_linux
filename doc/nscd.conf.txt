## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The file _/etc/nscd.conf_ is read from nscd(8) at startup.  Each
           line specifies either an attribute and a value, or an attribute,
           service, and a value.  Fields are separated either by SPACE or
           TAB characters.  A '#' (number sign) indicates the beginning of a
           comment; following characters, up to the end of the line, are not
           interpreted by nscd.
    
           Valid services are _passwd_ , _group_ , _hosts_ , _services_ , or _netgroup_.
    
           logfile _debug-file-name_
                  Specifies name of the file to which debug info should be
                  written.
    
           debug-level _value_
                  Sets the desired debug level.  The default is 0.
    
           threads _number_
                  This is the number of threads that are started to wait for
                  requests.  At least five threads will always be created.
    
           max-threads _number_
                  Specifies the maximum number of threads.  The default is
                  32.
    
           server-user _user_
                  If this option is set, nscd will run as this user and not
                  as root.  If a separate cache for every user is used (-S
                  parameter), this option is ignored.
    
           stat-user _user_
                  Specifies the user who is allowed to request statistics.
    
           reload-count unlimited | _number_
                  Limit on the number of times a cached entry gets reloaded
                  without being used before it gets removed.  The default is
                  5.
    
           paranoia _< yes|no>_
                  Enabling paranoia mode causes nscd to restart itself
                  periodically.  The default is no.
    
           restart-interval _time_
                  Sets the restart interval to _time_ seconds if periodic
                  restart is enabled by enabling paranoia mode.  The default
                  is 3600.
    
           enable-cache _service <yes|no>_
                  Enables or disables the specified _service_ cache.  The
                  default is no.
    
           positive-time-to-live _service value_
                  Sets the TTL (time-to-live) for positive entries
                  (successful queries) in the specified cache for _service_.
                  _Value_ is in seconds.  Larger values increase cache hit
                  rates and reduce mean response times, but increase
                  problems with cache coherence.
    
           negative-time-to-live _service value_
                  Sets the TTL (time-to-live) for negative entries
                  (unsuccessful queries) in the specified cache for _service_.
                  _Value_ is in seconds.  Can result in significant
                  performance improvements if there are several files owned
                  by UIDs (user IDs) not in system databases (for example
                  untarring the Linux kernel sources as root); should be
                  kept small to reduce cache coherency problems.
    
           suggested-size _service value_
                  This is the internal hash table size, _value_ should remain
                  a prime number for optimum efficiency.  The default is
                  211.
    
           check-files _service <yes|no>_
                  Enables or disables checking the file belonging to the
                  specified _service_ for changes.  The files are _/etc/passwd_ ,
                  _/etc/group_ , _/etc/hosts_ , _/etc/services_ , and _/etc/netgroup_.
                  The default is yes.
    
           persistent _service <yes|no>_
                  Keep the content of the cache for _service_ over server
                  restarts; useful when paranoia mode is set.  The default
                  is no.
    
           shared _service <yes|no>_
                  The memory mapping of the nscd databases for _service_ is
                  shared with the clients so that they can directly search
                  in them instead of having to ask the daemon over the
                  socket each time a lookup is performed.  The default is
                  no.
    
           max-db-size _service bytes_
                  The maximum allowable size, in bytes, of the database
                  files for the _service_.  The default is 33554432.
    
           auto-propagate _service <yes|no>_
                  When set to _no_ for _passwd_ or _group_ service, then the
                  _.byname_ requests are not added to _passwd.byuid_ or
                  _group.bygid_ cache.  This can help with tables containing
                  multiple records for the same ID.  The default is yes.
                  This option is valid only for services _passwd_ and _group_.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The default values stated in this manual page originate from the
           source code of nscd(8) and are used if not overridden in the
           configuration file.  The default values used in the configuration
           file of your distribution might differ.

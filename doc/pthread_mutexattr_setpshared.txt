## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These functions get and set the process-shared attribute in a
           mutex attributes object.  This attribute must be appropriately
           set to ensure correct, efficient operation of a mutex created
           using this attributes object.
    
           The process-shared attribute can have one of the following
           values:
    
           PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE
                  Mutexes created with this attributes object are to be
                  shared only among threads in the same process that
                  initialized the mutex.  This is the default value for the
                  process-shared mutex attribute.
    
           PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
                  Mutexes created with this attributes object can be shared
                  between any threads that have access to the memory
                  containing the object, including threads in different
                  processes.
    
           pthread_mutexattr_getpshared () places the value of the process-
           shared attribute of the mutex attributes object referred to by
           _attr_ in the location pointed to by _pshared_.
    
           pthread_mutexattr_setpshared () sets the value of the process-
           shared attribute of the mutex attributes object referred to by
           _attr_ to the value specified in pshared.
    
           If _attr_ does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object,
           the behavior is undefined.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, these functions return 0.  On error, they return a
           positive error number.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           pthread_mutexattr_setpshared () can fail with the following
           errors:
    
           EINVAL The value specified in _pshared_ is invalid.
    
           ENOTSUP
                  _pshared is_ PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED but the implementation
                  does not support process-shared mutexes.

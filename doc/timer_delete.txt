## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           timer_delete () deletes the timer whose ID is given in _timerid_.
           If the timer was armed at the time of this call, it is disarmed
           before being deleted.  The treatment of any pending signal
           generated by the deleted timer is unspecified.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, timer_delete () returns 0.  On failure, -1 is
           returned, and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL _timerid_ is not a valid timer ID.

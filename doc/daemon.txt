## NAME         top
    
    
           daemon - run in the background
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int daemon(int _nochdir_ , int _noclose_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           daemon ():
               Since glibc 2.21:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               In glibc 2.19 and 2.20:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
               Up to and including glibc 2.19:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The daemon () function is for programs wishing to detach
           themselves from the controlling terminal and run in the
           background as system daemons.
    
           If _nochdir_ is zero, daemon () changes the process's current
           working directory to the root directory ("/"); otherwise, the
           current working directory is left unchanged.
    
           If _noclose_ is zero, daemon () redirects standard input, standard
           output, and standard error to _/dev/null_ ; otherwise, no changes
           are made to these file descriptors.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           (This function forks, and if the fork(2) succeeds, the parent
           calls _exit(2), so that further errors are seen by the child
           only.)  On success daemon () returns zero.  If an error occurs,
           daemon () returns -1 and sets _errno_ to any of the errors specified
           for the fork(2) and setsid(2).

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           Not in POSIX.1.  A similar function appears on the BSDs.  The
           daemon () function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The glibc implementation can also return -1 when _/dev/null_ exists
           but is not a character device with the expected major and minor
           numbers.  In this case, _errno_ need not be set.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           The GNU C library implementation of this function was taken from
           BSD, and does not employ the double-fork technique (i.e.,
           fork(2), setsid(2), fork(2)) that is necessary to ensure that the
           resulting daemon process is not a session leader.  Instead, the
           resulting daemon _is_ a session leader.  On systems that follow
           System V semantics (e.g., Linux), this means that if the daemon
           opens a terminal that is not already a controlling terminal for
           another session, then that terminal will inadvertently become the
           controlling terminal for the daemon.

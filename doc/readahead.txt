## NAME         top
    
    
           readahead - initiate file readahead into page cache
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #define _GNU_SOURCE / See feature_test_macros(7) /
           #include <fcntl.h>
    
           ssize_t readahead(int _fd_ , off64_t _offset_ , size_t _count_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           readahead () initiates readahead on a file so that subsequent
           reads from that file will be satisfied from the cache, and not
           block on disk I/O (assuming the readahead was initiated early
           enough and that other activity on the system did not in the
           meantime flush pages from the cache).
    
           The _fd_ argument is a file descriptor identifying the file which
           is to be read.  The _offset_ argument specifies the starting point
           from which data is to be read and _count_ specifies the number of
           bytes to be read.  I/O is performed in whole pages, so that
           _offset_ is effectively rounded down to a page boundary and bytes
           are read up to the next page boundary greater than or equal to
           _(offset+count)_.  readahead () does not read beyond the end of the
           file.  The file offset of the open file description referred to
           by the file descriptor _fd_ is left unchanged.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, readahead () returns 0; on failure, -1 is returned,
           with _errno_ set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EBADF _fd_ is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for
                  reading.
    
           EINVAL _fd_ does not refer to a file type to which readahead () can
                  be applied.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The readahead () system call appeared in Linux 2.4.13; glibc
           support has been provided since version 2.3.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           The readahead () system call is Linux-specific, and its use should
           be avoided in portable applications.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for this
           system call differs, for the reasons described in syscall(2).
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           readahead () attempts to schedule the reads in the background and
           return immediately.  However, it may block while it reads the
           filesystem metadata needed to locate the requested blocks.  This
           occurs frequently with ext[234] on large files using indirect
           blocks instead of extents, giving the appearance that the call
           blocks until the requested data has been read.

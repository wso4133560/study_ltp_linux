           ipc_namespaces - overview of Linux IPC namespaces
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           IPC namespaces isolate certain IPC resources, namely, System V
           IPC objects (see sysvipc(7)) and (since Linux 2.6.30) POSIX
           message queues (see mq_overview(7)).  The common characteristic
           of these IPC mechanisms is that IPC objects are identified by
           mechanisms other than filesystem pathnames.
    
           Each IPC namespace has its own set of System V IPC identifiers
           and its own POSIX message queue filesystem.  Objects created in
           an IPC namespace are visible to all other processes that are
           members of that namespace, but are not visible to processes in
           other IPC namespaces.
    
           The following _/proc_ interfaces are distinct in each IPC
           namespace:
    
             The POSIX message queue interfaces in _/proc/sys/fs/mqueue_.
    
             The System V IPC interfaces in _/proc/sys/kernel_ , namely:
              _msgmax_ , _msgmnb_ , _msgmni_ , _sem_ , _shmall_ , _shmmax_ , _shmmni_ , and
              _shm_rmid_forced_.
    
             The System V IPC interfaces in _/proc/sysvipc_.
    
           When an IPC namespace is destroyed (i.e., when the last process
           that is a member of the namespace terminates), all IPC objects in
           the namespace are automatically destroyed.
    
           Use of IPC namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with
           the CONFIG_IPC_NS option.

## NAME         top
    
    
           __ppc_yield, __ppc_mdoio, __ppc_mdoom - Hint the processor to
           release shared resources
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/platform/ppc.h>
    
           void __ppc_yield(void);
           void __ppc_mdoio(void);
           void __ppc_mdoom(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These functions provide hints about the usage of resources that
           are shared with other processors on the Power architecture.  They
           can be used, for example, if a program waiting on a lock intends
           to divert the shared resources to be used by other processors.
    
           __ppc_yield () provides a hint that performance will probably be
           improved if shared resources dedicated to the executing processor
           are released for use by other processors.
    
           __ppc_mdoio () provides a hint that performance will probably be
           improved if shared resources dedicated to the executing processor
           are released until all outstanding storage accesses to caching-
           inhibited storage have been completed.
    
           __ppc_mdoom () provides a hint that performance will probably be
           improved if shared resources dedicated to the executing processor
           are released until all outstanding storage accesses to cacheable
           storage for which the data is not in the cache have been
           completed.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.18.

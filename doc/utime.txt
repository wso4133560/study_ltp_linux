    UTIME(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               UTIME(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           utime, utimes - change file last access and modification times
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <utime.h>
    
           int utime(const char  _filename_ , const struct utimbuf  _times_ );
    
           #include <sys/time.h>
    
           int utimes(const char  _filename_ , const struct timeval _times_ [2]);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Note: modern applications may prefer to use the interfaces
           described in utimensat(2).
    
           The utime () system call changes the access and modification times
           of the inode specified by _filename_ to the _actime_ and _modtime_
           fields of _times_ respectively.
    
           If _times_ is NULL, then the access and modification times of the
           file are set to the current time.
    
           Changing timestamps is permitted when: either the process has
           appropriate privileges, or the effective user ID equals the user
           ID of the file, or _times_ is NULL and the process has write
           permission for the file.
    
           The _utimbuf_ structure is:
    
               struct utimbuf {
                   time_t actime;       / access time /
                   time_t modtime;      / modification time /
               };
    
           The utime () system call allows specification of timestamps with a
           resolution of 1 second.
    
           The utimes () system call is similar, but the _times_ argument
           refers to an array rather than a structure.  The elements of this
           array are _timeval_ structures, which allow a precision of 1
           microsecond for specifying timestamps.  The _timeval_ structure is:
    
               struct timeval {
                   long tv_sec;        / seconds /
                   long tv_usec;       / microseconds /
               };
    
           _times[0]_ specifies the new access time, and _times[1]_ specifies
           the new modification time.  If _times_ is NULL, then analogously to
           utime (), the access and modification times of the file are set to
           the current time.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EACCES Search permission is denied for one of the directories in
                  the path prefix of _path_ (see also path_resolution(7)).
    
           EACCES _times_ is NULL, the caller's effective user ID does not
                  match the owner of the file, the caller does not have
                  write access to the file, and the caller is not privileged
                  (Linux: does not have either the CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE or the
                  CAP_FOWNER capability).
    
           ENOENT _filename_ does not exist.
    
           EPERM _times_ is not NULL, the caller's effective UID does not
                  match the owner of the file, and the caller is not
                  privileged (Linux: does not have the CAP_FOWNER
                  capability).
    
           EROFS _path_ resides on a read-only filesystem.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           utime (): SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 marks utime () as
           obsolete.
    
           utimes (): 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Linux does not allow changing the timestamps on an immutable
           file, or setting the timestamps to something other than the
           current time on an append-only file.

## NAME         top
    
    
           get_phys_pages, get_avphys_pages - get total and available
           physical page counts
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/sysinfo.h>
    
           long get_phys_pages(void);
           long get_avphys_pages(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The function get_phys_pages () returns the total number of
           physical pages of memory available on the system.
    
           The function get_avphys_pages () returns the number of currently
           available physical pages of memory on the system.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, these functions return a nonnegative value as given
           in DESCRIPTION.  On failure, they return -1 and set _errno_ to
           indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           ENOSYS The system could not provide the required information
                  (possibly because the _/proc_ filesystem was not mounted).
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These functions are GNU extensions.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Before glibc 2.23, these functions obtained the required
           information by scanning the _MemTotal_ and _MemFree_ fields of
           _/proc/meminfo_.  Since glibc 2.23, these functions obtain the
           required information by calling sysinfo(2).
    
           The following sysconf(3) calls provide a portable means of
           obtaining the same information as the functions described on this
           page.
    
               total_pages = sysconf(_SC_PHYS_PAGES);    / total pages /
               avl_pages = sysconf(_SC_AVPHYS_PAGES);    / available pages /
    
## EXAMPLES         top
    
    
           The following example shows how get_phys_pages () and
           get_avphys_pages () can be used.
    
           #include <stdio.h>
           #include <stdlib.h>
           #include <sys/sysinfo.h>
    
           int
           main(int argc, char argv[])
           {
               printf("This system has %ld pages of physical memory and "
                       "%ld pages of physical memory available.\n",
                       get_phys_pages(), get_avphys_pages());
               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }

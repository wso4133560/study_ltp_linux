           mbsnrtowcs ():
               Since glibc 2.10:

               Before glibc 2.10:

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The mbsnrtowcs () function is like the mbsrtowcs(3) function,
           except that the number of bytes to be converted, starting at
           _src_ , is limited to at most _nms_ bytes.
    
           If _dest_ is not NULL, the mbsnrtowcs () function converts at most
           _nms_ bytes from the multibyte string _src_ to a wide-character
           string starting at _dest_.  At most _len_ wide characters are written
           to _dest_.  The shift state _ps_ is updated.  The conversion is
           effectively performed by repeatedly calling _mbrtowc(dest, src,_
           _n, ps)_ where _n_ is some positive number, as long as this call
           succeeds, and then incrementing _dest_ by one and _src_ by the
           number of bytes consumed.  The conversion can stop for three
           reasons:
    
           1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.  In this
              case, _src_ is left pointing to the invalid multibyte sequence,
              _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and _errno_ is set to EILSEQ.
    
           2. The _nms_ limit forces a stop, or _len_ non-L'\0' wide characters
              have been stored at _dest_.  In this case, _src_ is left pointing
              to the next multibyte sequence to be converted, and the number
              of wide characters written to _dest_ is returned.
    
           3. The multibyte string has been completely converted, including
              the terminating null wide character ('\0') (which has the side
              effect of bringing back _ps_ to the initial state).  In this
              case, _src_ is set to NULL, and the number of wide characters
              written to _dest_ , excluding the terminating null wide
              character, is returned.
    
           According to POSIX.1, if the input buffer ends with an incomplete
           character, it is unspecified whether conversion stops at the end
           of the previous character (if any), or at the end of the input
           buffer.  The glibc implementation adopts the former behavior.
    
           If _dest_ is NULL, _len_ is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as
           above, except that the converted wide characters are not written
           out to memory, and that no destination length limit exists.
    
           In both of the above cases, if _ps_ is NULL, a static anonymous
           state known only to the mbsnrtowcs () function is used instead.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _len_
           wide characters at _dest_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The mbsnrtowcs () function returns the number of wide characters
           that make up the converted part of the wide-character string, not
           including the terminating null wide character.  If an invalid
           multibyte sequence was encountered, _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and
           _errno_ set to EILSEQ.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2008.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of mbsnrtowcs () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.
    
           Passing NULL as _ps_ is not multithread safe.

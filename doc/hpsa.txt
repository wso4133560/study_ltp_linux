           hpsa - HP Smart Array SCSI driver
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           modprobe hpsa [ hpsa_allow_any=1 ]
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           hpsa is a SCSI driver for HP Smart Array RAID controllers.
    
       Options
           _hpsa_allow_any=1_ : This option allows the driver to attempt to
           operate on any HP Smart Array hardware RAID controller, even if
           it is not explicitly known to the driver.  This allows newer
           hardware to work with older drivers.  Typically this is used to
           allow installation of operating systems from media that predates
           the RAID controller, though it may also be used to enable hpsa to
           drive older controllers that would normally be handled by the
           cciss(4) driver.  These older boards have not been tested and are
           not supported with hpsa , and cciss(4) should still be used for
           these.
    
       Supported hardware
           The hpsa driver supports the following Smart Array boards:
    
               Smart Array P700M
               Smart Array P212
               Smart Array P410
               Smart Array P410i
               Smart Array P411
               Smart Array P812
               Smart Array P712m
               Smart Array P711m
               StorageWorks P1210m
    
           Since Linux 4.14, the following Smart Array boards are also
           supported:
    
               Smart Array 5300
               Smart Array 5312
               Smart Array 532
               Smart Array 5i
               Smart Array 6400
               Smart Array 6400 EM

               Smart Array 6i
               Smart Array E200
               Smart Array E200i
               Smart Array E200i
               Smart Array E200i
               Smart Array E200i
               Smart Array E500
               Smart Array P400
               Smart Array P400i
               Smart Array P600
               Smart Array P700m
               Smart Array P800
    
       Configuration details
           To configure HP Smart Array controllers, use the HP Array
           Configuration Utility (either hpacuxe (8) or hpacucli (8)) or the
           Offline ROM-based Configuration Utility (ORCA) run from the Smart
           Array's option ROM at boot time.

       Device nodes
           Logical drives are accessed via the SCSI disk driver (sd(4)),
           tape drives via the SCSI tape driver (st(4)), and the RAID
           controller via the SCSI generic driver ( sg (4)), with device nodes
           named _/dev/sd_ , _/dev/st_ , and _/dev/sg_ , respectively.
    
       HPSA-specific host attribute files in /sys
           _/sys/class/scsi_host/host/rescan_
                  This is a write-only attribute.  Writing to this attribute
                  will cause the driver to scan for new, changed, or removed
                  devices (e.g., hot-plugged tape drives, or newly
                  configured or deleted logical drives, etc.)  and notify
                  the SCSI midlayer of any changes detected.  Normally a
                  rescan is triggered automatically by HP's Array
                  Configuration Utility (either the GUI or the command-line
                  variety); thus, for logical drive changes, the user should
                  not normally have to use this attribute.  This attribute
                  may be useful when hot plugging devices like tape drives,
                  or entire storage boxes containing preconfigured logical
                  drives.
    
           _/sys/class/scsi_host/host/firmware_revision_
                  This attribute contains the firmware version of the Smart
                  Array.
    
                  For example:
    
                      # cd /sys/class/scsi_host/host4
                      # cat firmware_revision
                      7.14
    
       HPSA-specific disk attribute files in /sys
           _/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/unique_id_
                  This attribute contains a 32 hex-digit unique ID for each
                  logical drive.
    
                  For example:
    
                      # cd /sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device
                      # cat unique_id
                      600508B1001044395355323037570F77
    
           _/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/raid_level_
                  This attribute contains the RAID level of each logical
                  drive.
    
                  For example:
    
                      # cd /sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device
                      # cat raid_level
                      RAID 0
    
           _/sys/class/scsi_disk/c:b:t:l/device/lunid_
                  This attribute contains the 16 hex-digit (8 byte) LUN ID
                  by which a logical drive or physical device can be
                  addressed.  _c_ : _b_ : _t_ : _l_ are the controller, bus, target, and
                  lun of the device.
    
           For example:
    
                      # cd /sys/class/scsi_disk/4:0:0:0/device
                      # cat lunid
                      0x0000004000000000
    
       Supported ioctl() operations
           For compatibility with applications written for the cciss(4)
           driver, many, but not all of the ioctls supported by the cciss(4)
           driver are also supported by the hpsa driver.  The data
           structures used by these ioctls are described in the Linux kernel
           source file _include/linux/cciss_ioctl.h_.
    
           CCISS_DEREGDISK , CCISS_REGNEWDISK , CCISS_REGNEWD
                  These three ioctls all do exactly the same thing, which is
                  to cause the driver to rescan for new devices.  This does
                  exactly the same thing as writing to the hpsa-specific
                  host "rescan" attribute.
    
           CCISS_GETPCIINFO
                  Returns PCI domain, bus, device, and function and "board
                  ID" (PCI subsystem ID).
    
           CCISS_GETDRIVVER
                  Returns driver version in three bytes encoded as:
    
                      (major_version << 16) | (minor_version << 8) |
                          (subminor_version)
    
           CCISS_PASSTHRU , CCISS_BIG_PASSTHRU
                  Allows "BMIC" and "CISS" commands to be passed through to
                  the Smart Array.  These are used extensively by the HP
                  Array Configuration Utility, SNMP storage agents, and so
                  on.  See _cciss_vol_status_ at ⟨http://cciss.sf.net⟩ for
                  some examples.

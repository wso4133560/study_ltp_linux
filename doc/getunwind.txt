## NAME         top
    
    
           getunwind - copy the unwind data to caller's buffer
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <syscall.h>
           #include <linux/unwind.h>
    
           long getunwind(void _buf_ , size_t _buf_size_ );
    
           _Note_ : There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           _Note: this function is obsolete._
    
           The IA-64-specific getunwind () system call copies the kernel's
           call frame unwind data into the buffer pointed to by _buf_ and
           returns the size of the unwind data; this data describes the gate
           page (kernel code that is mapped into user space).
    
           The size of the buffer _buf_ is specified in _buf_size_.  The data is
           copied only if _buf_size_ is greater than or equal to the size of
           the unwind data and _buf_ is not NULL; otherwise, no data is
           copied, and the call succeeds, returning the size that would be
           needed to store the unwind data.
    
           The first part of the unwind data contains an unwind table.  The
           rest contains the associated unwind information, in no particular
           order.  The unwind table contains entries of the following form:
    
               u64 start;      (64-bit address of start of function)
               u64 end;        (64-bit address of end of function)
               u64 info;       (BUF-relative offset to unwind info)
    
           An entry whose _start_ value is zero indicates the end of the
           table.  For more information about the format, see the _IA-64_
           _Software Conventions and Runtime Architecture_ manual.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, getunwind () returns the size of the unwind data.  On
           error, -1 is returned and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           getunwind () fails with the error EFAULT if the unwind info can't
           be stored in the space specified by _buf_.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           This system call is available since Linux 2.4.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This system call is Linux-specific, and is available only on the
           IA-64 architecture.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           This system call has been deprecated.  The modern way to obtain
           the kernel's unwind data is via the vdso(7).
    
           Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; in the
           unlikely event that you want to call it, use syscall(2).

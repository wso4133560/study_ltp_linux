## NAME         top
    
    
           socketpair - create a pair of connected sockets
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/socket.h>
    
           int socketpair(int _domain_ , int _type_ , int _protocol_ , int _sv_ [2]);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The socketpair () call creates an unnamed pair of connected
           sockets in the specified _domain_ , of the specified _type_ , and using
           the optionally specified _protocol_.  For further details of these
           arguments, see socket(2).
    
           The file descriptors used in referencing the new sockets are
           returned in _sv[0]_ and _sv[1]_.  The two sockets are
           indistinguishable.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, _errno_ is
           set to indicate the error, and _sv_ is left unchanged
    
           On Linux (and other systems), socketpair () does not modify _sv_ on
           failure.  A requirement standardizing this behavior was added in
           POSIX.1-2008 TC2.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EAFNOSUPPORT
                  The specified address family is not supported on this
                  machine.
    
           EFAULT The address _sv_ does not specify a valid part of the
                  process address space.
    
           EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file
                  descriptors has been reached.
    
           ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
                  has been reached.
    
           EOPNOTSUPP
                  The specified protocol does not support creation of socket
                  pairs.
    
           EPROTONOSUPPORT
                  The specified protocol is not supported on this machine.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD.  socketpair () first appeared
           in 4.2BSD.  It is generally portable to/from non-BSD systems
           supporting clones of the BSD socket layer (including System V
           variants).
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           On Linux, the only supported domains for this call are AF_UNIX
           (or synonymously, AF_LOCAL ) and AF_TIPC (since Linux 4.12).
    
           Since Linux 2.6.27, socketpair () supports the SOCK_NONBLOCK and
           SOCK_CLOEXEC flags in the _type_ argument, as described in
           socket(2).

## NAME         top
    
    
           clog2, clog2f, clog2l - base-2 logarithm of a complex number
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <complex.h>
    
           double complex clog2(double complex _z_ );
           float complex clog2f(float complex _z_ );
           long double complex clog2l(long double complex _z_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The call _clog2(z)_ is equivalent to clog(z)/log(2).
    
           The other functions perform the same task for _float_ and _long_
           _double_.
    
           Note that _z_ close to zero will cause an overflow.

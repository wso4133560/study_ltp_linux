## NAME         top
    
    
           sync, syncfs - commit filesystem caches to disk
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           void sync(void);
    
           int syncfs(int _fd_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           sync ():
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
                   || / Since glibc 2.19: / _DEFAULT_SOURCE
                   || / Glibc <= 2.19: / _BSD_SOURCE
    
           syncfs ():
               _GNU_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           sync () causes all pending modifications to filesystem metadata
           and cached file data to be written to the underlying filesystems.
    
           syncfs () is like sync (), but synchronizes just the filesystem
           containing file referred to by the open file descriptor _fd_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           syncfs () returns 0 on success; on error, it returns -1 and sets
           _errno_ to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           sync () is always successful.
    
           syncfs () can fail for at least the following reasons:
    
           EBADF _fd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           EIO An error occurred during synchronization.  This error may
                  relate to data written to any file on the filesystem, or
                  on metadata related to the filesystem itself.
    
           ENOSPC Disk space was exhausted while synchronizing.
    
           ENOSPC , EDQUOT
                  Data was written to a files on NFS or another filesystem
                  which does not allocate space at the time of a write(2)
                  system call, and some previous write failed due to
                  insufficient storage space.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           syncfs () first appeared in Linux 2.6.39; library support was
           added to glibc in version 2.14.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           sync (): POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.
    
           syncfs () is Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Since glibc 2.2.2, the Linux prototype for sync () is as listed
           above, following the various standards.  In glibc 2.2.1 and
           earlier, it was "int sync(void)", and sync () always returned 0.
    
           According to the standard specification (e.g., POSIX.1-2001),
           sync () schedules the writes, but may return before the actual
           writing is done.  However Linux waits for I/O completions, and
           thus sync () or syncfs () provide the same guarantees as fsync ()
           called on every file in the system or filesystem respectively.
    
           In mainline kernel versions prior to 5.8, syncfs () will fail only
           when passed a bad file descriptor ( EBADF ).  Since Linux 5.8,
           syncfs () will also report an error if one or more inodes failed
           to be written back since the last syncfs () call.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           Before version 1.3.20 Linux did not wait for I/O to complete
           before returning.

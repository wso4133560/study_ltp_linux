## NAME         top
    
    
           gethostname, sethostname - get/set hostname
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int gethostname(char  _name_ , size_t _len_ );
           int sethostname(const char  _name_ , size_t _len_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           gethostname ():
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
                   || / Glibc 2.19 and earlier / _BSD_SOURCE

               Since glibc 2.21:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               In glibc 2.19 and 2.20:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
               Up to and including glibc 2.19:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These system calls are used to access or to change the system
           hostname.  More precisely, they operate on the hostname
           associated with the calling process's UTS namespace.
    
           sethostname () sets the hostname to the value given in the
           character array _name_.  The _len_ argument specifies the number of
           bytes in _name_.  (Thus, _name_ does not require a terminating null
           byte.)
    
           gethostname () returns the null-terminated hostname in the
           character array _name_ , which has a length of _len_ bytes.  If the
           null-terminated hostname is too large to fit, then the name is
           truncated, and no error is returned (but see NOTES below).
           POSIX.1 says that if such truncation occurs, then it is
           unspecified whether the returned buffer includes a terminating
           null byte.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT _name_ is an invalid address.
    
           EINVAL _len_ is negative or, for sethostname (), _len_ is larger than
                  the maximum allowed size.
    
           ENAMETOOLONG
                  (glibc gethostname ()) _len_ is smaller than the actual size.
                  (Before version 2.1, glibc uses EINVAL for this case.)
    
           EPERM For sethostname (), the caller did not have the
                  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in the user namespace associated
                  with its UTS namespace (see namespaces(7)).
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           SVr4, 4.4BSD  (these interfaces first appeared in 4.2BSD).
           POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 specify gethostname () but not
           sethostname ().
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           SUSv2 guarantees that "Host names are limited to 255 bytes".
           POSIX.1 guarantees that "Host names (not including the
           terminating null byte) are limited to HOST_NAME_MAX bytes".  On
           Linux, HOST_NAME_MAX is defined with the value 64, which has been
           the limit since Linux 1.0 (earlier kernels imposed a limit of 8
           bytes).
    
       C library/kernel differences
           The GNU C library does not employ the gethostname () system call;
           instead, it implements gethostname () as a library function that
           calls uname(2) and copies up to _len_ bytes from the returned
           _nodename_ field into _name_.  Having performed the copy, the
           function then checks if the length of the _nodename_ was greater
           than or equal to _len_ , and if it is, then the function returns -1
           with _errno_ set to ENAMETOOLONG ; in this case, a terminating null
           byte is not included in the returned _name_.
    
           Versions of glibc before 2.2 handle the case where the length of
           the _nodename_ was greater than or equal to _len_ differently:
           nothing is copied into _name_ and the function returns -1 with
           _errno_ set to ENAMETOOLONG.

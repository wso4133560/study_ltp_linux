           termio - System V terminal driver interface
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           termio is the name of the old System V terminal driver interface.
           This interface defined a _termio_ structure used to store terminal
           settings, and a range of ioctl(2) operations to get and set
           terminal attributes.
    
           The termio interface is now obsolete: POSIX.1-1990 standardized a
           modified version of this interface, under the name termios.  The
           POSIX.1 data structure differs slightly from the System V
           version, and POSIX.1 defined a suite of functions to replace the
           various ioctl(2) operations that existed in System V.  (This was
           done because ioctl(2) was unstandardized, and its variadic third
           argument does not allow argument type checking.)
    
           If you're looking for a page called "termio", then you can
           probably find most of the information that you seek in either
           termios(3) or ioctl_tty(2).

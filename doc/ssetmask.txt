    SGETMASK(2)             Linux Programmer's Manual            SGETMASK(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           sgetmask, ssetmask - manipulation of signal mask (obsolete)
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           long sgetmask(void);
           long ssetmask(long _newmask_ );
    
           _Note_ : There are no glibc wrappers for these system calls; see
           NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These system calls are obsolete.  _Do not use them_ ; use
           sigprocmask(2) instead.
    
           sgetmask () returns the signal mask of the calling process.
    
           ssetmask () sets the signal mask of the calling process to the
           value given in _newmask_.  The previous signal mask is returned.
    
           The signal masks dealt with by these two system calls are plain
           bit masks (unlike the _sigset_t_ used by sigprocmask(2)); use
           sigmask(3) to create and inspect these masks.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           sgetmask () always successfully returns the signal mask.
           ssetmask () always succeeds, and returns the previous signal mask.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           These system calls always succeed.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           Since Linux 3.16, support for these system calls is optional,
           depending on whether the kernel was built with the
           CONFIG_SGETMASK_SYSCALL option.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These system calls are Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Glibc does not provide wrappers for these obsolete system calls;
           in the unlikely event that you want to call them, use syscall(2).
    
           These system calls are unaware of signal numbers greater than 31
           (i.e., real-time signals).
    
           These system calls do not exist on x86-64.
    
           It is not possible to block SIGSTOP or SIGKILL.

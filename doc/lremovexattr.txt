    REMOVEXATTR(2)          Linux Programmer's Manual         REMOVEXATTR(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           removexattr, lremovexattr, fremovexattr - remove an extended
           attribute
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/xattr.h>
    
           int removexattr(const char  _path_ , const char  _name_ );
           int lremovexattr(const char  _path_ , const char  _name_ );
           int fremovexattr(int _fd_ , const char  _name_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Extended attributes are _name_ : _value_ pairs associated with inodes
           (files, directories, symbolic links, etc.).  They are extensions
           to the normal attributes which are associated with all inodes in
           the system (i.e., the stat(2) data).  A complete overview of
           extended attributes concepts can be found in xattr(7).
    
           removexattr () removes the extended attribute identified by _name_
           and associated with the given _path_ in the filesystem.
    
           lremovexattr () is identical to removexattr (), except in the case
           of a symbolic link, where the extended attribute is removed from
           the link itself, not the file that it refers to.
    
           fremovexattr () is identical to removexattr (), only the extended
           attribute is removed from the open file referred to by _fd_ (as
           returned by open(2)) in place of _path_.
    
           An extended attribute name is a null-terminated string.  The _name_
           includes a namespace prefix; there may be several, disjoint
           namespaces associated with an individual inode.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On failure, -1 is returned and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           ENODATA
                  The named attribute does not exist.
    
           ENOTSUP
                  Extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem,
                  or are disabled.
    
           In addition, the errors documented in stat(2) can also occur.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           These system calls have been available on Linux since kernel 2.4;
           glibc support is provided since version 2.3.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These system calls are Linux-specific.

    IOCTL_FSLABEL(2)        Linux Programmer's Manual       IOCTL_FSLABEL(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           ioctl_fslabel - get or set a filesystem label
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/ioctl.h>
           #include <linux/fs.h>
    
           int ioctl(int _fd_ , FS_IOC_GETFSLABEL, char _label_ [FSLABEL_MAX]);
           int ioctl(int _fd_ , FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL, char _label_ [FSLABEL_MAX]);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           If a filesystem supports online label manipulation, these
           ioctl(2) operations can be used to get or set the filesystem
           label for the filesystem on which fd resides.  The
           FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL operation requires privilege ( CAP_SYS_ADMIN ).
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and _errno_
           is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           Possible errors include (but are not limited to) the following:
    
           EFAULT _label_ references an inaccessible memory area.
    
           EINVAL The specified label exceeds the maximum label length for
                  the filesystem.
    
           ENOTTY This can appear if the filesystem does not support online
                  label manipulation.
    
           EPERM The calling process does not have sufficient permissions
                  to set the label.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           These ioctl(2) operations first appeared in Linux 4.18.  They
           were previously known as BTRFS_IOC_GET_FSLABEL and
           BTRFS_IOC_SET_FSLABEL and were private to Btrfs.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This API is Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The maximum string length for this interface is FSLABEL_MAX ,
           including the terminating null byte ('\0').  Filesystems have
           differing maximum label lengths, which may or may not include the
           terminating null.  The string provided to FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL must
           always be null-terminated, and the string returned by
           FS_IOC_GETFSLABEL will always be null-terminated.

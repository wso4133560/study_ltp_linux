    ISWALNUM(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            ISWALNUM(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           iswalnum - test for alphanumeric wide character
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wctype.h>
    
           int iswalnum(wint_t _wc_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The iswalnum () function is the wide-character equivalent of the
           isalnum(3) function.  It tests whether _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "alnum".
    
           The wide-character class "alnum" is a subclass of the wide-
           character class "graph", and therefore also a subclass of the
           wide-character class "print".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
           character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "cntrl".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
           character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "space" and its subclass "blank".
    
           The wide-character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-
           character class "punct".
    
           The wide-character class "alnum" is the union of the wide-
           character classes "alpha" and "digit".  As such, it also contains
           the wide-character class "xdigit".
    
           The wide-character class "alnum" always contains at least the
           letters 'A' to 'Z', 'a' to 'z' and the digits '0' to '9'.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The iswalnum () function returns nonzero if _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "alnum".  Otherwise, it
           returns zero.

           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of iswalnum () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.

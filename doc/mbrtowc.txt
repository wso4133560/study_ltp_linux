## NAME         top
    
    
           mbrtowc - convert a multibyte sequence to a wide character
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           size_t mbrtowc(wchar_t restrict _pwc_ , const char restrict _s_ , size_t _n_ ,
                          mbstate_t restrict _ps_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The main case for this function is when _s_ is not NULL and _pwc_ is
           not NULL.  In this case, the mbrtowc () function inspects at most
           _n_ bytes of the multibyte string starting at _s_ , extracts the next
           complete multibyte character, converts it to a wide character and
           stores it at _pwc_.  It updates the shift state _ps_.  If the
           converted wide character is not L'\0' (the null wide character),
           it returns the number of bytes that were consumed from _s_.  If the
           converted wide character is L'\0', it resets the shift state _ps_
           to the initial state and returns 0.
    
           If the _n_ bytes starting at _s_ do not contain a complete multibyte
           character, mbrtowc () returns _(size_t) -2_.  This can happen even
           if _n_ >= _MB_CUR_MAX_ , if the multibyte string contains redundant
           shift sequences.
    
           If the multibyte string starting at _s_ contains an invalid
           multibyte sequence before the next complete character, mbrtowc ()
           returns _(size_t) -1_ and sets _errno_ to EILSEQ.  In this case, the
           effects on _ps_ are undefined.
    
           A different case is when _s_ is not NULL but _pwc_ is NULL.  In this
           case, the mbrtowc () function behaves as above, except that it
           does not store the converted wide character in memory.
    
           A third case is when _s_ is NULL.  In this case, _pwc_ and _n_ are
           ignored.  If the conversion state represented by _ps_ denotes an
           incomplete multibyte character conversion, the mbrtowc () function
           returns _(size_t) -1_ , sets _errno_ to EILSEQ , and leaves _ps_ in an
           undefined state.  Otherwise, the mbrtowc () function puts _ps_ in
           the initial state and returns 0.
    
           In all of the above cases, if _ps_ is NULL, a static anonymous
           state known only to the mbrtowc () function is used instead.
           Otherwise, _ps_ must be a valid _mbstate_t_ object.  An _mbstate_t_
           object _a_ can be initialized to the initial state by zeroing it,
           for example using
    
               memset(&a, 0, sizeof(a));
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The mbrtowc () function returns the number of bytes parsed from
           the multibyte sequence starting at _s_ , if a non-L'\0' wide
           character was recognized.  It returns 0, if a L'\0' wide
           character was recognized.  It returns _(size_t) -1_ and sets _errno_
           to EILSEQ , if an invalid multibyte sequence was encountered.  It
           returns _(size_t) -2_ if it couldn't parse a complete multibyte
           character, meaning that _n_ should be increased.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of mbrtowc () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
           current locale.

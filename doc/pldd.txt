## NAME         top
    
    
           pldd - display dynamic shared objects linked into a process
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           pldd _pid_
           pldd _option_
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The pldd command displays a list of the dynamic shared objects
           (DSOs) that are linked into the process with the specified
           process ID (PID).  The list includes the libraries that have been
           dynamically loaded using dlopen(3).
    
## OPTIONS         top
    
    
           -? , --help
                  Display a help message and exit.
    
           --usage
                  Display a short usage message and exit.
    
           -V , --version
                  Display program version information and exit.
    
## EXIT STATUS         top
    
    
           On success, pldd exits with the status 0.  If the specified
           process does not exist, the user does not have permission to
           access its dynamic shared object list, or no command-line
           arguments are supplied, pldd exists with a status of 1.  If given
           an invalid option, it exits with the status 64.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           pldd is available since glibc 2.15.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           The pldd command is not specified by POSIX.1.  Some other systems
           have a similar command.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The command
    
               lsof -p PID
    
           also shows output that includes the dynamic shared objects that
           are linked into a process.
    
           The gdb(1) _info shared_ command also shows the shared libraries
           being used by a process, so that one can obtain similar output to
           pldd using a command such as the following (to monitor the
           process with the specified _pid_ ):
    
               $ gdb -ex "set confirm off" -ex "set height 0" -ex "info shared" \
                       -ex "quit" -p $pid | grep '^0x.0x'
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           From glibc 2.19 to 2.29, pldd was broken: it just hung when
           executed.  This problem was fixed in glibc 2.30, and the fix has
           been backported to earlier glibc versions in some distributions.

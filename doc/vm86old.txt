    VM86(2)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                VM86(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           vm86old, vm86 - enter virtual 8086 mode
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/vm86.h>
    
           int vm86old(struct vm86_struct  _info_ );
           int vm86(unsigned long _fn_ , struct vm86plus_struct  _v86_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The system call vm86 () was introduced in Linux 0.97p2.  In Linux
           2.1.15 and 2.0.28, it was renamed to vm86old (), and a new vm86 ()
           was introduced.  The definition of _struct vm86_struct_ was changed
           in 1.1.8 and 1.1.9.
    
           These calls cause the process to enter VM86 mode (virtual-8086 in
           Intel literature), and are used by dosemu.
    
           VM86 mode is an emulation of real mode within a protected mode
           task.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT This return value is specific to i386 and indicates a
                  problem with getting user-space data.
    
           ENOSYS This return value indicates the call is not implemented on
                  the present architecture.
    
           EPERM Saved kernel stack exists.  (This is a kernel sanity
                  check; the saved stack should exist only within vm86 mode
                  itself.)
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This call is specific to Linux on 32-bit Intel processors, and
           should not be used in programs intended to be portable.

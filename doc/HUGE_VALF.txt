## NAME         top
    
    
           INFINITY, NAN, HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VALL - floating-point
           constants
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #define _ISOC99_SOURCE / See feature_test_macros(7) /
           #include <math.h>
    
           INFINITY
    
           NAN
    
           HUGE_VAL
           HUGE_VALF
           HUGE_VALL
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The macro INFINITY expands to a _float_ constant representing
           positive infinity.
    
           The macro NAN expands to a _float_ constant representing a quiet
           NaN (when supported).  A _quiet_ NaN is a NaN ("not-a-number") that
           does not raise exceptions when it is used in arithmetic.  The
           opposite is a _signaling_ NaN.  See IEC 60559:1989.
    
           The macros HUGE_VAL , HUGE_VALF , HUGE_VALL expand to constants of
           types _double_ , _float_ , and _long double_ , respectively, that
           represent a large positive value, possibly positive infinity.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           C99.
    
           On a glibc system, the macro HUGE_VAL is always available.
           Availability of the NAN macro can be tested using #ifdef NAN , and
           similarly for INFINITY , HUGE_VALF , HUGE_VALL.  They will be
           defined by _< math.h>_ if _ISOC99_SOURCE or _GNU_SOURCE is defined,
           or __STDC_VERSION__ is defined and has a value not less than
           199901L.

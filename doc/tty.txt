## NAME         top
    
    
           tty - controlling terminal
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The file _/dev/tty_ is a character file with major number 5 and
           minor number 0, usually with mode 0666 and ownership root:tty.
           It is a synonym for the controlling terminal of a process, if
           any.
    
           In addition to the ioctl(2) requests supported by the device that
           tty refers to, the ioctl(2) request TIOCNOTTY is supported.
    
       TIOCNOTTY
           Detach the calling process from its controlling terminal.
    
           If the process is the session leader, then SIGHUP and SIGCONT
           signals are sent to the foreground process group and all
           processes in the current session lose their controlling tty.
    
           This ioctl(2) call works only on file descriptors connected to
           _/dev/tty_.  It is used by daemon processes when they are invoked
           by a user at a terminal.  The process attempts to open _/dev/tty_.
           If the open succeeds, it detaches itself from the terminal by
           using TIOCNOTTY , while if the open fails, it is obviously not
           attached to a terminal and does not need to detach itself.

           motd - message of the day
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The contents of _/etc/motd_ are displayed by login(1) after a
           successful login but just before it executes the login shell.
    
           The abbreviation "motd" stands for "message of the day", and this
           file has been traditionally used for exactly that (it requires
           much less disk space than mail to all users).

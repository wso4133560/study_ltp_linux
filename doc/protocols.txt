## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This file is a plain ASCII file, describing the various DARPA
           internet protocols that are available from the TCP/IP subsystem.
           It should be consulted instead of using the numbers in the ARPA
           include files, or, even worse, just guessing them.  These numbers
           will occur in the protocol field of any IP header.
    
           Keep this file untouched since changes would result in incorrect
           IP packages.  Protocol numbers and names are specified by the
           IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
    
           Each line is of the following format:
    
                  _protocol number aliases ..._
    
           where the fields are delimited by spaces or tabs.  Empty lines
           are ignored.  If a line contains a hash mark (#), the hash mark
           and the part of the line following it are ignored.
    
           The field descriptions are:
    
           _protocol_
                  the native name for the protocol.  For example _ip_ , _tcp_ , or
                  _udp_.
    
           _number_ the official number for this protocol as it will appear
                  within the IP header.
    
           _aliases_
                  optional aliases for the protocol.
    
           This file might be distributed over a network using a network-
           wide naming service like Yellow Pages/NIS or BIND/Hesiod.

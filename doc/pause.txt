## SYNOPSIS         top

           int pause(void);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           pause () causes the calling process (or thread) to sleep until a
           signal is delivered that either terminates the process or causes
           the invocation of a signal-catching function.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           pause () returns only when a signal was caught and the signal-
           catching function returned.  In this case, pause () returns -1,
           and _errno_ is set to EINTR.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINTR a signal was caught and the signal-catching function
                  returned.

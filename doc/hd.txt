## NAME         top
    
    
           hd - MFM/IDE hard disk devices
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The hd devices are block devices to access MFM/IDE hard disk
           drives in raw mode.  The master drive on the primary IDE
           controller (major device number 3) is hda ; the slave drive is
           hdb.  The master drive of the second controller (major device
           number 22) is hdc and the slave is hdd.
    
           General IDE block device names have the form hd _X_ , or hd _XP_ , where
           _X_ is a letter denoting the physical drive, and _P_ is a number
           denoting the partition on that physical drive.  The first form,
           hd _X_ , is used to address the whole drive.  Partition numbers are
           assigned in the order the partitions are discovered, and only
           nonempty, nonextended partitions get a number.  However,
           partition numbers 1â€“4 are given to the four partitions described
           in the MBR (the "primary" partitions), regardless of whether they
           are unused or extended.  Thus, the first logical partition will
           be hd _X_ 5.  Both DOS-type partitioning and BSD-disklabel
           partitioning are supported.  You can have at most 63 partitions
           on an IDE disk.
    
           For example, _/dev/hda_ refers to all of the first IDE drive in the
           system; and _/dev/hdb3_ refers to the third DOS "primary" partition
           on the second one.
    
           They are typically created by:
    
               mknod -m 660 /dev/hda b 3 0
               mknod -m 660 /dev/hda1 b 3 1
               mknod -m 660 /dev/hda2 b 3 2
               ...
               mknod -m 660 /dev/hda8 b 3 8
               mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb b 3 64
               mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb1 b 3 65
               mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb2 b 3 66
               ...
               mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb8 b 3 72
               chown root:disk /dev/hd

    IPC(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 IPC(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           ipc - System V IPC system calls
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           int ipc(unsigned int _call_ , int _first_ , unsigned long _second_ ,
                   unsigned long _third_ , void  _ptr_ , long _fifth_ );
    
           _Note_ : There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           ipc () is a common kernel entry point for the System V IPC calls
           for messages, semaphores, and shared memory.  _call_ determines
           which IPC function to invoke; the other arguments are passed
           through to the appropriate call.
    
           User-space programs should call the appropriate functions by
           their usual names.  Only standard library implementors and kernel
           hackers need to know about ipc ().
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           ipc () is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs
           intended to be portable.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           On some architectures—for example x86-64 and ARM—there is no
           ipc () system call; instead, msgctl(2), semctl(2), shmctl(2), and
           so on really are implemented as separate system calls.
    
           Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; in the
           unlikely event that you want to call it directly, you can do so
           using syscall(2).
    
## SEE ALSO         top

           semop(2), semtimedop(2), shmat(2), shmctl(2), shmdt(2),
           shmget(2), sysvipc(7)

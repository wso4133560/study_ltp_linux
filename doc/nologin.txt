## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           If the file _/etc/nologin_ exists and is readable, login(1) will
           allow access only to root.  Other users will be shown the
           contents of this file and their logins will be refused.  This
           provides a simple way of temporarily disabling all unprivileged
           logins.

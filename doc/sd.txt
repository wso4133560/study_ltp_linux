## NAME         top
    
    
           sd - driver for SCSI disk drives
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <linux/hdreg.h>        / for HDIO_GETGEO /
           #include <linux/fs.h>           / for BLKGETSIZE and BLKRRPART /
    
## CONFIGURATION         top
    
    
           The block device name has the following form: sd _lp,_ where _l_ is a
           letter denoting the physical drive, and _p_ is a number denoting
           the partition on that physical drive.  Often, the partition
           number, _p_ , will be left off when the device corresponds to the
           whole drive.
    
           SCSI disks have a major device number of 8, and a minor device
           number of the form (16  _drive_number_ ) + _partition_number_ , where
           _drive_number_ is the number of the physical drive in order of
           detection, and _partition_number_ is as follows:
    
           +3     partition 0 is the whole drive
    
                  partitions 1–4 are the DOS "primary" partitions
    
                  partitions 5–8 are the DOS "extended" (or "logical")
                  partitions
    
           For example, _/dev/sda_ will have major 8, minor 0, and will refer
           to all of the first SCSI drive in the system; and _/dev/sdb3_ will
           have major 8, minor 19, and will refer to the third DOS "primary"
           partition on the second SCSI drive in the system.
    
           At this time, only block devices are provided.  Raw devices have
           not yet been implemented.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The following _ioctl_ s are provided:
    
           HDIO_GETGEO
                  Returns the BIOS disk parameters in the following
                  structure:
    
               struct hd_geometry {
                   unsigned char  heads;
                   unsigned char  sectors;
                   unsigned short cylinders;
                   unsigned long  start;
               };
    
                  A pointer to this structure is passed as the ioctl(2)
                  parameter.
    
                  The information returned in the parameter is the disk
                  geometry of the drive _as understood by DOS!_  This geometry
                  is _not_ the physical geometry of the drive.  It is used
                  when constructing the drive's partition table, however,
                  and is needed for convenient operation of fdisk (1),
                  efdisk (1), and lilo (1).  If the geometry information is
                  not available, zero will be returned for all of the
                  parameters.
    
           BLKGETSIZE
                  Returns the device size in sectors.  The ioctl(2)
                  parameter should be a pointer to a _long_.
    
           BLKRRPART
                  Forces a reread of the SCSI disk partition tables.  No
                  parameter is needed.
    
                  The SCSI ioctl(2) operations are also supported.  If the
                  ioctl(2) parameter is required, and it is NULL, then
                  ioctl(2) fails with the error EINVAL.

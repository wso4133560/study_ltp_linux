    TKILL(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               TKILL(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           tkill, tgkill - send a signal to a thread
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           int tkill(pid_t _tid_ , int _sig_ );
           int tgkill(pid_t _tgid_ , pid_t _tid_ , int _sig_ );
    
           _Note_ : There is no glibc wrapper for tkill (); see NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           tgkill () sends the signal _sig_ to the thread with the thread ID
           _tid_ in the thread group _tgid_.  (By contrast, kill(2) can be used
           to send a signal only to a process (i.e., thread group) as a
           whole, and the signal will be delivered to an arbitrary thread
           within that process.)
    
           tkill () is an obsolete predecessor to tgkill ().  It allows only
           the target thread ID to be specified, which may result in the
           wrong thread being signaled if a thread terminates and its thread
           ID is recycled.  Avoid using this system call.
    
           These are the raw system call interfaces, meant for internal
           thread library use.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EAGAIN The RLIMIT_SIGPENDING resource limit was reached and _sig_
                  is a real-time signal.
    
           EAGAIN Insufficient kernel memory was available and _sig_ is a
                  real-time signal.
    
           EINVAL An invalid thread ID, thread group ID, or signal was
                  specified.
    
           EPERM Permission denied.  For the required permissions, see
                  kill(2).
    
           ESRCH No process with the specified thread ID (and thread group
                  ID) exists.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           tkill () is supported since Linux 2.4.19 / 2.5.4.  tgkill () was
           added in Linux 2.5.75.
    
           Library support for tgkill () was added to glibc in version 2.30.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           tkill () and tgkill () are Linux-specific and should not be used in
           programs that are intended to be portable.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           See the description of CLONE_THREAD in clone(2) for an
           explanation of thread groups.
    
           Glibc does not provide a wrapper for tkill (); call it using
           syscall(2).  Before glibc 2.30, there was also no wrapper
           function for tgkill ().

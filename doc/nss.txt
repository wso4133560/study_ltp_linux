## NAME         top
    
    
           nss - Name Service Switch configuration file
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Each call to a function which retrieves data from a system
           database like the password or group database is handled by the
           Name Service Switch implementation in the GNU C library.  The
           various services provided are implemented by independent modules,
           each of which naturally varies widely from the other.
    
           The default implementations coming with the GNU C library are by
           default conservative and do not use unsafe data.  This might be
           very costly in some situations, especially when the databases are
           large.  Some modules allow the system administrator to request
           taking shortcuts if these are known to be safe.  It is then the
           system administrator's responsibility to ensure the assumption is
           correct.
    
           There are other modules where the implementation changed over
           time.  If an implementation used to sacrifice speed for memory
           consumption, it might create problems if the preference is
           switched.
    
           The _/etc/default/nss_ file contains a number of variable
           assignments.  Each variable controls the behavior of one or more
           NSS modules.  White spaces are ignored.  Lines beginning with '#'
           are treated as comments.
    
           The variables currently recognized are:
    
           NETID_AUTHORITATIVE = _TRUE_ | _FALSE_
                  If set to TRUE, the NIS backend for the initgroups(3)
                  function will accept the information from the _netid.byname_
                  NIS map as authoritative.  This can speed up the function
                  significantly if the _group.byname_ map is large.  The
                  content of the _netid.byname_ map is used as is.  The system
                  administrator has to make sure it is correctly generated.
    
           SERVICES_AUTHORITATIVE = _TRUE_ | _FALSE_
                  If set to TRUE, the NIS backend for the getservbyname(3)
                  and getservbyname_r(3) functions will assume that the
                  _services.byservicename_ NIS map exists and is
                  authoritative, particularly that it contains both keys
                  with /proto and without /proto for both primary service
                  names and service aliases.  The system administrator has
                  to make sure it is correctly generated.
    
           SETENT_BATCH_READ = _TRUE_ | _FALSE_
                  If set to TRUE, the NIS backend for the setpwent(3) and
                  setgrent(3) functions will read the entire database at
                  once and then hand out the requests one by one from memory
                  with every corresponding getpwent(3) or getgrent(3) call
                  respectively.  Otherwise, each getpwent(3) or getgrent(3)
                  call might result in a network communication with the
                  server to get the next entry.

           The default configuration corresponds to the following
           configuration file:
    
               NETID_AUTHORITATIVE=FALSE
               SERVICES_AUTHORITATIVE=FALSE
               SETENT_BATCH_READ=FALSE

## NAME         top
    
    
           scalb, scalbf, scalbl - multiply floating-point number by
           integral power of radix (OBSOLETE)
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <math.h>
    
           double scalb(double _x_ , double _exp_ );
           float scalbf(float _x_ , float _exp_ );
           long double scalbl(long double _x_ , long double _exp_ );
    
           Link with _-lm_.

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These functions multiply their first argument _x_ by FLT_RADIX
           (probably 2) to the power of _exp_ , that is:
    
               x  FLT_RADIX  exp
    
           The definition of FLT_RADIX can be obtained by including
           _< float.h>_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, these functions return _x_  FLT_RADIX  _exp_.
    
           If _x_ or _exp_ is a NaN, a NaN is returned.
    
           If _x_ is positive infinity (negative infinity), and _exp_ is not
           negative infinity, positive infinity (negative infinity) is
           returned.
    
           If _x_ is +0 (-0), and _exp_ is not positive infinity, +0 (-0) is
           returned.
    
           If _x_ is zero, and _exp_ is positive infinity, a domain error
           occurs, and a NaN is returned.
    
           If _x_ is an infinity, and _exp_ is negative infinity, a domain error
           occurs, and a NaN is returned.
    
           If the result overflows, a range error occurs, and the functions
           return HUGE_VAL , HUGE_VALF , or HUGE_VALL , respectively, with a
           sign the same as _x_.
    
           If the result underflows, a range error occurs, and the functions
           return zero, with a sign the same as _x_.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           See math_error(7) for information on how to determine whether an
           error has occurred when calling these functions.
    
           The following errors can occur:
    
           Domain error: _x_ is 0, and _exp_ is positive infinity, or _x_ is
           positive infinity and _exp_ is negative infinity and the other
           argument is not a NaN
                  _errno_ is set to EDOM.  An invalid floating-point exception
                  ( FE_INVALID ) is raised.
    
           Range error, overflow
                  _errno_ is set to ERANGE.  An overflow floating-point
                  exception ( FE_OVERFLOW ) is raised.
    
           Range error, underflow
                  _errno_ is set to ERANGE.  An underflow floating-point
                  exception ( FE_UNDERFLOW ) is raised.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           scalb () is specified in POSIX.1-2001, but marked obsolescent.
           POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of scalb (), recommending
           the use of scalbln(3), scalblnf(3), or scalblnl(3) instead.  The
           scalb () function is from 4.3BSD.
    
           scalbf () and scalbl () are unstandardized; scalbf () is
           nevertheless present on several other systems
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           Before glibc 2.20, these functions did not set _errno_ for domain
           and range errors.

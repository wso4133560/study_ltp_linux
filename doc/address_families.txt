## NAME         top
    
    
           address_families - socket address families (domains)
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/types.h>          / See NOTES /
           #include <sys/socket.h>
    
           int socket(int _domain_ , int _type_ , int _protocol_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The _domain_ argument of the socket(2) specifies a communication
           domain; this selects the protocol family which will be used for
           communication.  These families are defined in _< sys/socket.h>_.

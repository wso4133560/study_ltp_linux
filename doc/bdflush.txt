    BDFLUSH(2)              Linux Programmer's Manual             BDFLUSH(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           bdflush - start, flush, or tune buffer-dirty-flush daemon
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/kdaemon.h>
    
           int bdflush(int _func_ , long  _address_ );
           int bdflush(int _func_ , long _data_ );
    
           _Note_ : There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see
           VERSIONS.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           _Note_ : Since Linux 2.6, this system call is deprecated and does
           nothing.  It is likely to disappear altogether in a future kernel
           release.  Nowadays, the task performed by bdflush () is handled by
           the kernel _pdflush_ thread.
    
           bdflush () starts, flushes, or tunes the buffer-dirty-flush
           daemon.  Only a privileged process (one with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
           capability) may call bdflush ().
    
           If _func_ is negative or 0, and no daemon has been started, then
           bdflush () enters the daemon code and never returns.
    
           If _func_ is 1, some dirty buffers are written to disk.
    
           If _func_ is 2 or more and is even (low bit is 0), then _address_ is
           the address of a long word, and the tuning parameter numbered
           ( _func_ -2)/2 is returned to the caller in that address.
    
           If _func_ is 3 or more and is odd (low bit is 1), then _data_ is a
           long word, and the kernel sets tuning parameter numbered
           ( _func_ -3)/2 to that value.
    
           The set of parameters, their values, and their valid ranges are
           defined in the Linux kernel source file _fs/buffer.c_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           If _func_ is negative or 0 and the daemon successfully starts,
           bdflush () never returns.  Otherwise, the return value is 0 on
           success and -1 on failure, with _errno_ set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EBUSY An attempt was made to enter the daemon code after another
                  process has already entered.
    
           EFAULT _address_ points outside your accessible address space.
    
           EINVAL An attempt was made to read or write an invalid parameter
                  number, or to write an invalid value to a parameter.
    
           EPERM Caller does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           Since version 2.23, glibc no longer supports this obsolete system
           call.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           bdflush () is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs
           intended to be portable.

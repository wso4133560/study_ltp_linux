    SETFSGID(2)             Linux Programmer's Manual            SETFSGID(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           setfsgid - set group identity used for filesystem checks
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/fsuid.h>
    
           int setfsgid(gid_t _fsgid_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           On Linux, a process has both a filesystem group ID and an
           effective group ID.  The (Linux-specific) filesystem group ID is
           used for permissions checking when accessing filesystem objects,
           while the effective group ID is used for some other kinds of
           permissions checks (see credentials(7)).
    
           Normally, the value of the process's filesystem group ID is the
           same as the value of its effective group ID.  This is so, because
           whenever a process's effective group ID is changed, the kernel
           also changes the filesystem group ID to be the same as the new
           value of the effective group ID.  A process can cause the value
           of its filesystem group ID to diverge from its effective group ID
           by using setfsgid () to change its filesystem group ID to the
           value given in _fsgid_.
    
           setfsgid () will succeed only if the caller is the superuser or if
           _fsgid_ matches either the caller's real group ID, effective group
           ID, saved set-group-ID, or current the filesystem user ID.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On both success and failure, this call returns the previous
           filesystem group ID of the caller.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           This system call is present in Linux since version 1.2.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           setfsgid () is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs
           intended to be portable.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The filesystem group ID concept and the setfsgid () system call
           were invented for historical reasons that are no longer
           applicable on modern Linux kernels.  See setfsuid(2) for a
           discussion of why the use of both setfsuid(2) and setfsgid () is
           nowadays unneeded.
    
           The original Linux setfsgid () system call supported only 16-bit
           group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added setfsgid32 () supporting
           32-bit IDs.  The glibc setfsgid () wrapper function transparently
           deals with the variation across kernel versions.
    
       C library/kernel differences
           In glibc 2.15 and earlier, when the wrapper for this system call
           determines that the argument can't be passed to the kernel
           without integer truncation (because the kernel is old and does
           not support 32-bit group IDs), it will return -1 and set _errno_ to
           EINVAL without attempting the system call.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           No error indications of any kind are returned to the caller, and
           the fact that both successful and unsuccessful calls return the
           same value makes it impossible to directly determine whether the
           call succeeded or failed.  Instead, the caller must resort to
           looking at the return value from a further call such as
           _setfsgid(-1)_ (which will always fail), in order to determine if a
           preceding call to setfsgid () changed the filesystem group ID.  At
           the very least, EPERM should be returned when the call fails
           (because the caller lacks the CAP_SETGID capability).

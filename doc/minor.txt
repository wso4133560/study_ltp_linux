## NAME         top
    
    
           makedev, major, minor - manage a device number
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/sysmacros.h>
    
           dev_t makedev(unsigned int _maj_ , unsigned int _min_ );
    
           unsigned int major(dev_t _dev_ );
           unsigned int minor(dev_t _dev_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           A device ID consists of two parts: a major ID, identifying the
           class of the device, and a minor ID, identifying a specific
           instance of a device in that class.  A device ID is represented
           using the type _dev_t_.
    
           Given major and minor device IDs, makedev () combines these to
           produce a device ID, returned as the function result.  This
           device ID can be given to mknod(2), for example.
    
           The major () and minor () functions perform the converse task:
           given a device ID, they return, respectively, the major and minor
           components.  These macros can be useful to, for example,
           decompose the device IDs in the structure returned by stat(2).

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           The makedev (), major (), and minor () functions are not specified
           in POSIX.1, but are present on many other systems.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           These interfaces are defined as macros.  Since glibc 2.3.3, they
           have been aliases for three GNU-specific functions:
           gnu_dev_makedev (), gnu_dev_major (), and gnu_dev_minor ().  The
           latter names are exported, but the traditional names are more
           portable.
    
           The BSDs expose the definitions for these macros via
           _< sys/types.h>_.  Depending on the version, glibc also exposes
           definitions for these macros from that header file if suitable
           feature test macros are defined.  However, this behavior was
           deprecated in glibc 2.25, and since glibc 2.28, _< sys/types.h>_ no
           longer provides these definitions.

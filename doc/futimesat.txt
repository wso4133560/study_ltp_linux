## NAME         top
    
    
           futimesat - change timestamps of a file relative to a directory
           file descriptor
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <fcntl.h> / Definition of AT_ constants /
           #include <sys/time.h>
    
           int futimesat(int _dirfd_ , const char  _pathname_ ,
                         const struct timeval _times_ [2]);
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           futimesat ():
               _GNU_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This system call is obsolete.  Use utimensat(2) instead.
    
           The futimesat () system call operates in exactly the same way as
           utimes(2), except for the differences described in this manual
           page.
    
           If the pathname given in _pathname_ is relative, then it is
           interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file
           descriptor _dirfd_ (rather than relative to the current working
           directory of the calling process, as is done by utimes(2) for a
           relative pathname).
    
           If _pathname_ is relative and _dirfd_ is the special value AT_FDCWD ,
           then _pathname_ is interpreted relative to the current working
           directory of the calling process (like utimes(2)).
    
           If _pathname_ is absolute, then _dirfd_ is ignored.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, futimesat () returns a 0.  On error, -1 is returned
           and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           The same errors that occur for utimes(2) can also occur for
           futimesat ().  The following additional errors can occur for
           futimesat ():
    
           EBADF _dirfd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           ENOTDIR
                  _pathname_ is relative and _dirfd_ is a file descriptor
                  referring to a file other than a directory.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           futimesat () was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16; library support
           was added to glibc in version 2.4.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This system call is nonstandard.  It was implemented from a
           specification that was proposed for POSIX.1, but that
           specification was replaced by the one for utimensat(2).
    
           A similar system call exists on Solaris.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
       Glibc notes
           If _pathname_ is NULL, then the glibc futimesat () wrapper function
           updates the times for the file referred to by _dirfd_.

           networks - network name information
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The file _/etc/networks_ is a plain ASCII file that describes known
           DARPA networks and symbolic names for these networks.  Each line
           represents a network and has the following structure:
    
                  _name number aliases ..._
    
           where the fields are delimited by spaces or tabs.  Empty lines
           are ignored.  The hash character ( # ) indicates the start of a
           comment: this character, and the remaining characters up to the
           end of the current line, are ignored by library functions that
           process the file.
    
           The field descriptions are:
    
           _name_   The symbolic name for the network.  Network names can
                  contain any printable characters except white-space
                  characters or the comment character.
    
           _number_ The official number for this network in numbers-and-dots
                  notation (see inet(3)).  The trailing ".0" (for the host
                  component of the network address) may be omitted.
    
           _aliases_
                  Optional aliases for the network.
    
           This file is read by the route(8) and netstat(8) utilities.  Only
           Class A, B, or C networks are supported, partitioned networks
           (i.e., network/26 or network/28) are not supported by this file.

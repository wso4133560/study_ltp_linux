           network_namespaces - overview of Linux network namespaces
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Network namespaces provide isolation of the system resources
           associated with networking: network devices, IPv4 and IPv6
           protocol stacks, IP routing tables, firewall rules, the _/proc/net_
           directory (which is a symbolic link to _/proc/PID/net_ ), the
           _/sys/class/net_ directory, various files under _/proc/sys/net_ , port
           numbers (sockets), and so on.  In addition, network namespaces
           isolate the UNIX domain abstract socket namespace (see unix(7)).
    
           A physical network device can live in exactly one network
           namespace.  When a network namespace is freed (i.e., when the
           last process in the namespace terminates), its physical network
           devices are moved back to the initial network namespace (not to
           the parent of the process).
    
           A virtual network (veth(4)) device pair provides a pipe-like
           abstraction that can be used to create tunnels between network
           namespaces, and can be used to create a bridge to a physical
           network device in another namespace.  When a namespace is freed,
           the veth(4) devices that it contains are destroyed.
    
           Use of network namespaces requires a kernel that is configured
           with the CONFIG_NET_NS option.

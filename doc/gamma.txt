## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These functions are deprecated: instead, use either the tgamma(3)
           or the lgamma(3) functions, as appropriate.
    
           For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).
    
       BSD version
           The libm in 4.4BSD and some versions of FreeBSD had a gamma ()
           function that computes the Gamma function, as one would expect.
    
       glibc version
           Glibc has a gamma () function that is equivalent to lgamma(3) and
           computes the natural logarithm of the Gamma function.

           Because of historical variations in behavior across systems, this
           function is not specified in any recent standard.  It was
           documented in SVID 2.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
       History
           4.2BSD had a gamma () that computed ln(|Gamma(| _x_ |)|), leaving the
           sign of Gamma(| _x_ |) in the external integer _signgam_.  In 4.3BSD
           the name was changed to lgamma(3), and the man page promises
    
               "At some time in the future the name gamma will be
               rehabilitated and used for the Gamma function"
    
           This did indeed happen in 4.4BSD, where gamma () computes the
           Gamma function (with no effect on _signgam_ ).  However, this came
           too late, and we now have tgamma(3), the "true gamma" function.

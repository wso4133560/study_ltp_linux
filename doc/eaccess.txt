## NAME         top
    
    
           euidaccess, eaccess - check effective user's permissions for a
           file
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #define _GNU_SOURCE / See feature_test_macros(7) /
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int euidaccess(const char  _pathname_ , int _mode_ );
           int eaccess(const char  _pathname_ , int _mode_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Like access(2), euidaccess () checks permissions and existence of
           the file identified by its argument _pathname_.  However, whereas
           access(2) performs checks using the real user and group
           identifiers of the process, euidaccess () uses the effective
           identifiers.
    
           _mode_ is a mask consisting of one or more of R_OK , W_OK , X_OK , and
           F_OK , with the same meanings as for access(2).
    
           eaccess () is a synonym for euidaccess (), provided for
           compatibility with some other systems.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success (all requested permissions granted), zero is returned.
           On error (at least one bit in _mode_ asked for a permission that is
           denied, or some other error occurred), -1 is returned, and _errno_
           is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           As for access(2).
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The eaccess () function was added to glibc in version 2.4.
    
## ATTRIBUTES         top
    
    
           For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           These functions are nonstandard.  Some other systems have an
           eaccess () function.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           _Warning_ : Using this function to check a process's permissions on
           a file before performing some operation based on that information
           leads to race conditions: the file permissions may change between
           the two steps.  Generally, it is safer just to attempt the
           desired operation and handle any permission error that occurs.
    
           This function always dereferences symbolic links.  If you need to
           check the permissions on a symbolic link, use faccessat(2) with
           the flags AT_EACCESS and AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW.

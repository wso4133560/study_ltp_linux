    LOOKUP_DCOOKIE(2)       Linux Programmer's Manual      LOOKUP_DCOOKIE(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           lookup_dcookie - return a directory entry's path
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           int lookup_dcookie(uint64_t _cookie_ , char  _buffer_ , size_t _len_ );
    
           _Note_ : There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Look up the full path of the directory entry specified by the
           value _cookie_.  The cookie is an opaque identifier uniquely
           identifying a particular directory entry.  The buffer given is
           filled in with the full path of the directory entry.
    
           For lookup_dcookie () to return successfully, the kernel must
           still hold a cookie reference to the directory entry.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, lookup_dcookie () returns the length of the path
           string copied into the buffer.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT The buffer was not valid.
    
           EINVAL The kernel has no registered cookie/directory entry
                  mappings at the time of lookup, or the cookie does not
                  refer to a valid directory entry.
    
           ENAMETOOLONG
                  The name could not fit in the buffer.
    
           ENOMEM The kernel could not allocate memory for the temporary
                  buffer holding the path.
    
           EPERM The process does not have the capability CAP_SYS_ADMIN
                  required to look up cookie values.
    
           ERANGE The buffer was not large enough to hold the path of the
                  directory entry.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           Available since Linux 2.5.43.  The ENAMETOOLONG error return was
           added in 2.5.70.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           lookup_dcookie () is Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           lookup_dcookie () is a special-purpose system call, currently used
           only by the oprofile(1) profiler.  It relies on a kernel driver
           to register cookies for directory entries.
    
           The path returned may be suffixed by the string " (deleted)" if
           the directory entry has been removed.
    
           Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; call it
           using syscall(2).

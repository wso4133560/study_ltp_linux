## NAME         top
    
    
           cpuid - x86 CPUID access device
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           CPUID provides an interface for querying information about the
           x86 CPU.
    
           This device is accessed by lseek(2) or pread(2) to the
           appropriate CPUID level and reading in chunks of 16 bytes.  A
           larger read size means multiple reads of consecutive levels.
    
           The lower 32 bits of the file position is used as the incoming
           _%eax_ , and the upper 32 bits of the file position as the incoming
           _%ecx_ , the latter is intended for "counting" _eax_ levels like
           _eax=4_.
    
           This driver uses _/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/cpuid_ , where _CPUNUM_ is the minor
           number, and on an SMP box will direct the access to CPU _CPUNUM_ as
           listed in _/proc/cpuinfo_.
    
           This file is protected so that it can be read only by the user
           _root_ , or members of the group _root_.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The CPUID instruction can be directly executed by a program using
           inline assembler.  However this device allows convenient access
           to all CPUs without changing process affinity.
    
           Most of the information in _cpuid_ is reported by the kernel in
           cooked form either in _/proc/cpuinfo_ or through subdirectories in
           _/sys/devices/system/cpu_.  Direct CPUID access through this device
           should only be used in exceptional cases.
    
           The _cpuid_ driver is not auto-loaded.  On modular kernels you
           might need to use the following command to load it explicitly
           before use:
    
               $ modprobe cpuid
    
           There is no support for CPUID functions that require additional
           input registers.
    
           Very old x86 CPUs don't support CPUID.

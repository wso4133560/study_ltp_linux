## NAME         top
    
    
           kernel_lockdown - kernel image access prevention feature
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The Kernel Lockdown feature is designed to prevent both direct
           and indirect access to a running kernel image, attempting to
           protect against unauthorized modification of the kernel image and
           to prevent access to security and cryptographic data located in
           kernel memory, whilst still permitting driver modules to be
           loaded.
    
           Lockdown is typically enabled during boot and may be terminated,
           if configured, by typing a special key combination on a directly
           attached physical keyboard.
    
           If a prohibited or restricted feature is accessed or used, the
           kernel will emit a message that looks like:
    
                   Lockdown: X: Y is restricted, see man kernel_lockdown.7
    
           where X indicates the process name and Y indicates what is
           restricted.
    
           On an EFI-enabled x86 or arm64 machine, lockdown will be
           automatically enabled if the system boots in EFI Secure Boot
           mode.
    
           If the kernel is appropriately configured, lockdown may be lifted
           by typing the appropriate sequence on a directly attached
           physical keyboard.  For x86 machines, this is _SysRq+x_.
    
       Coverage
           When lockdown is in effect, a number of features are disabled or
           have their use restricted.  This includes special device files
           and kernel services that allow direct access of the kernel image:
    
                  /dev/mem
                  /dev/kmem
                  /dev/kcore
                  /dev/ioports
                  BPF
                  kprobes
    
           and the ability to directly configure and control devices, so as
           to prevent the use of a device to access or modify a kernel
           image:
    
           • The use of module parameters that directly specify hardware
             parameters to drivers through the kernel command line or when
             loading a module.
    
           • The use of direct PCI BAR access.
    
           • The use of the ioperm and iopl instructions on x86.
    
           • The use of the KDIO console ioctls.
    
           • The use of the TIOCSSERIAL serial ioctl.
    
           • The alteration of MSR registers on x86.
    
           • The replacement of the PCMCIA CIS.
    
           • The overriding of ACPI tables.
    
           • The use of ACPI error injection.
    
           • The specification of the ACPI RDSP address.
    
           • The use of ACPI custom methods.
    
           Certain facilities are restricted:
    
           • Only validly signed modules may be loaded (waived if the module
             file being loaded is vouched for by IMA appraisal).
    
           • Only validly signed binaries may be kexec'd (waived if the
             binary image file to be executed is vouched for by IMA
             appraisal).
    
           • Unencrypted hibernation/suspend to swap are disallowed as the
             kernel image is saved to a medium that can then be accessed.
    
           • Use of debugfs is not permitted as this allows a whole range of
             actions including direct configuration of, access to and
             driving of hardware.
    
           • IMA requires the addition of the "secure_boot" rules to the
             policy, whether or not they are specified on the command line,
             for both the built-in and custom policies in secure boot
             lockdown mode.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The Kernel Lockdown feature was added in Linux 5.4.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The Kernel Lockdown feature is enabled by
           CONFIG_SECURITY_LOCKDOWN_LSM.  The _lsm=lsm1,...,lsmN_ command line
           parameter controls the sequence of the initialization of Linux
           Security Modules.  It must contain the string _lockdown_ to enable
           the Kernel Lockdown feature.  If the command line parameter is
           not specified, the initialization falls back to the value of the
           deprecated _security=_ command line parameter and further to the
           value of CONFIG_LSM.

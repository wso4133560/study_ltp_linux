## NAME         top
    
    
           stpcpy - copy a string returning a pointer to its end
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <string.h>
    
           char stpcpy(char restrict _dest_ , const char restrict _src_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           stpcpy ():
               Since glibc 2.10:
                   _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
               Before glibc 2.10:

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The stpcpy () function copies the string pointed to by _src_
           (including the terminating null byte ('\0')) to the array pointed
           to by _dest_.  The strings may not overlap, and the destination
           string _dest_ must be large enough to receive the copy.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           stpcpy () returns a pointer to the end of the string _dest_ (that
           is, the address of the terminating null byte) rather than the
           beginning.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This function was added to POSIX.1-2008.  Before that, it was not
           part of the C or POSIX.1 standards, nor customary on UNIX
           systems.  It first appeared at least as early as 1986, in the
           Lattice C AmigaDOS compiler, then in the GNU fileutils and GNU
           textutils in 1989, and in the GNU C library by 1992.  It is also
           present on the BSDs.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           This function may overrun the buffer _dest_.
    
## EXAMPLES         top
    
    
           For example, this program uses stpcpy () to concatenate foo and
           bar to produce foobar , which it then prints.
    
           #define _GNU_SOURCE
           #include <string.h>
           #include <stdio.h>
    
           int
           main(void)
           {
               char buffer[20];
               char to = buffer;
    
               to = stpcpy(to, "foo");
               to = stpcpy(to, "bar");
               printf("%s\n", buffer);
           }

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           Hostnames are domains, where a domain is a hierarchical, dot-
           separated list of subdomains; for example, the machine "monet",
           in the "example" subdomain of the "com" domain would be
           represented as "monet.example.com".
    
           Each element of the hostname must be from 1 to 63 characters long
           and the entire hostname, including the dots, can be at most 253
           characters long.  Valid characters for hostnames are ASCII(7)
           letters from _a_ to _z_ , the digits from _0_ to _9_ , and the hyphen (-).
           A hostname may not start with a hyphen.
    
           Hostnames are often used with network client and server programs,
           which must generally translate the name to an address for use.
           (This task is generally performed by either getaddrinfo(3) or the
           obsolete gethostbyname(3).)
    
           Hostnames are resolved by the NSS framework in glibc according to
           the hosts configuration in nsswitch.conf.  The DNS-based name
           resolver (in the dns NSS service module) resolves them in the
           following fashion.
    
           If the name consists of a single component, that is, contains no
           dot, and if the environment variable HOSTALIASES is set to the
           name of a file, that file is searched for any string matching the
           input hostname.  The file should consist of lines made up of two
           white-space separated strings, the first of which is the hostname
           alias, and the second of which is the complete hostname to be
           substituted for that alias.  If a case-insensitive match is found
           between the hostname to be resolved and the first field of a line
           in the file, the substituted name is looked up with no further
           processing.
    
           If the input name ends with a trailing dot, the trailing dot is
           removed, and the remaining name is looked up with no further
           processing.
    
           If the input name does not end with a trailing dot, it is looked
           up by searching through a list of domains until a match is found.
           The default search list includes first the local domain, then its
           parent domains with at least 2 name components (longest first).
           For example, in the domain cs.example.com, the name lithium.cchem
           will be checked first as lithium.cchem.cs.example and then as
           lithium.cchem.example.com.  lithium.cchem.com will not be tried,
           as there is only one component remaining from the local domain.
           The search path can be changed from the default by a system-wide
           configuration file (see resolver(5)).

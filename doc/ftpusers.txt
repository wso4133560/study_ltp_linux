           ftpusers - list of users that may not log in via the FTP daemon
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The text file ftpusers contains a list of users that may not log
           in using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server daemon.  This
           file is used not merely for system administration purposes but
           also for improving security within a TCP/IP networked
           environment.
    
           The ftpusers file will typically contain a list of the users that
           either have no business using ftp or have too many privileges to
           be allowed to log in through the FTP server daemon.  Such users
           usually include root, daemon, bin, uucp, and news.
    
           If your FTP server daemon doesn't use ftpusers , then it is
           suggested that you read its documentation to find out how to
           block access for certain users.  Washington University FTP server
           Daemon (wuftpd) and Professional FTP Daemon (proftpd) are known
           to make use of ftpusers.
    
       Format
           The format of ftpusers is very simple.  There is one account name
           (or username) per line.  Lines starting with a # are ignored.

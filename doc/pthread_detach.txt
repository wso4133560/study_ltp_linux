## NAME         top
    
    
           pthread_detach - detach a thread
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <pthread.h>
    
           int pthread_detach(pthread_t _thread_ );
    
           Compile and link with _-pthread_.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The pthread_detach () function marks the thread identified by
           _thread_ as detached.  When a detached thread terminates, its
           resources are automatically released back to the system without
           the need for another thread to join with the terminated thread.
    
           Attempting to detach an already detached thread results in
           unspecified behavior.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, pthread_detach () returns 0; on error, it returns an
           error number.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL _thread_ is not a joinable thread.
    
           ESRCH No thread with the ID _thread_ could be found.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           Once a thread has been detached, it can't be joined with
           pthread_join(3) or be made joinable again.
    
           A new thread can be created in a detached state using
           pthread_attr_setdetachstate(3) to set the detached attribute of
           the _attr_ argument of pthread_create(3).
    
           The detached attribute merely determines the behavior of the
           system when the thread terminates; it does not prevent the thread
           from being terminated if the process terminates using exit(3) (or
           equivalently, if the main thread returns).
    
           Either pthread_join(3) or pthread_detach () should be called for
           each thread that an application creates, so that system resources
           for the thread can be released.  (But note that the resources of
           any threads for which one of these actions has not been done will
           be freed when the process terminates.)
    
## EXAMPLES         top
    
    
           The following statement detaches the calling thread:
    
               pthread_detach(pthread_self());

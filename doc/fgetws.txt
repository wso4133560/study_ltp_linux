    FGETWS(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              FGETWS(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           fgetws - read a wide-character string from a FILE stream
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           wchar_t fgetws(wchar_t restrict _ws_ , int _n_ , FILE restrict _stream_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The fgetws () function is the wide-character equivalent of the
           fgets(3) function.  It reads a string of at most _n-1_ wide
           characters into the wide-character array pointed to by _ws_ , and
           adds a terminating null wide character (L'\0').  It stops reading
           wide characters after it has encountered and stored a newline
           wide character.  It also stops when end of stream is reached.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _n_ wide
           characters at _ws_.
    
           For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The fgetws () function, if successful, returns _ws_.  If end of
           stream was already reached or if an error occurred, it returns
           NULL.

           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of fgetws () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
           current locale.
    
           In the absence of additional information passed to the fopen(3)
           call, it is reasonable to expect that fgetws () will actually read
           a multibyte string from the stream and then convert it to a wide-
           character string.
    
           This function is unreliable, because it does not permit to deal
           properly with null wide characters that may be present in the
           input.

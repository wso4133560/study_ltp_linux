           int readdir_r(DIR restrict _dirp_ , struct dirent restrict _entry_ ,

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This function is deprecated; use readdir(3) instead.
    
           The readdir_r () function was invented as a reentrant version of
           readdir(3).  It reads the next directory entry from the directory
           stream _dirp_ , and returns it in the caller-allocated buffer
           pointed to by _entry_.  For details of the _dirent_ structure, see
           readdir(3).
    
           A pointer to the returned buffer is placed in _result_ ; if the end
           of the directory stream was encountered, then NULL is instead
           returned in _result_.
    
           It is recommended that applications use readdir(3) instead of
           readdir_r ().  Furthermore, since version 2.24, glibc deprecates
           readdir_r ().  The reasons are as follows:
    
             On systems where NAME_MAX is undefined, calling readdir_r ()
              may be unsafe because the interface does not allow the caller
              to specify the length of the buffer used for the returned
              directory entry.
    
             On some systems, readdir_r () can't read directory entries with
              very long names.  When the glibc implementation encounters
              such a name, readdir_r () fails with the error ENAMETOOLONG
              _after the final directory entry has been read_.  On some other
              systems, readdir_r () may return a success status, but the
              returned _d_name_ field may not be null terminated or may be
              truncated.
    
             In the current POSIX.1 specification (POSIX.1-2008),
              readdir(3) is not required to be thread-safe.  However, in
              modern implementations (including the glibc implementation),
              concurrent calls to readdir(3) that specify different
              directory streams are thread-safe.  Therefore, the use of
              readdir_r () is generally unnecessary in multithreaded
              programs.  In cases where multiple threads must read from the
              same directory stream, using readdir(3) with external
              synchronization is still preferable to the use of readdir_r (),
              for the reasons given in the points above.
    
             It is expected that a future version of POSIX.1 will make
              readdir_r () obsolete, and require that readdir(3) be thread-
              safe when concurrently employed on different directory
              streams.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The readdir_r () function returns 0 on success.  On error, it
           returns a positive error number (listed under ERRORS).  If the
           end of the directory stream is reached, readdir_r () returns 0,
           and returns NULL in _result_.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EBADF Invalid directory stream descriptor _dirp_.
    
           ENAMETOOLONG
                  A directory entry whose name was too long to be read was
                  encountered.

## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           Unimplemented system calls.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           These system calls are not implemented in the Linux kernel.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           These system calls always return -1 and set _errno_ to ENOSYS.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Note that ftime(3), profil(3), and ulimit(3) are implemented as
           library functions.
    
           Some system calls, like alloc_hugepages(2), free_hugepages(2),
           ioperm(2), iopl(2), and vm86(2) exist only on certain
           architectures.
    
           Some system calls, like ipc(2), create_module(2), init_module(2),
           and delete_module(2) exist only when the Linux kernel was built
           with support for them.

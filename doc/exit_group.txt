## NAME         top
    
    
           exit_group - exit all threads in a process
    
## SYNOPSIS         top

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This system call is equivalent to _exit(2) except that it
           terminates not only the calling thread, but all threads in the
           calling process's thread group.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           This system call does not return.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           This call is present since Linux 2.5.35.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This call is Linux-specific.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Since glibc 2.3, this is the system call invoked when the
           _exit(2) wrapper function is called.

## NAME         top
    
    
           mbrlen - determine number of bytes in next multibyte character
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           size_t mbrlen(const char restrict _s_ , size_t _n_ ,
                         mbstate_t restrict _ps_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The mbrlen () function inspects at most _n_ bytes of the multibyte
           string starting at _s_ and extracts the next complete multibyte
           character.  It updates the shift state _ps_.  If the multibyte
           character is not the null wide character, it returns the number
           of bytes that were consumed from _s_.  If the multibyte character
           is the null wide character, it resets the shift state _ps_ to the
           initial state and returns 0.
    
           If the _n_ bytes starting at _s_ do not contain a complete multibyte
           character, mbrlen () returns _(size_t) -2_.  This can happen even if
           _n_ >= _MB_CUR_MAX_ , if the multibyte string contains redundant shift
           sequences.
    
           If the multibyte string starting at _s_ contains an invalid
           multibyte sequence before the next complete character, mbrlen ()
           returns _(size_t) -1_ and sets _errno_ to EILSEQ.  In this case, the
           effects on _ps_ are undefined.
    
           If _ps_ is NULL, a static anonymous state known only to the
           mbrlen () function is used instead.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The mbrlen () function returns the number of bytes parsed from the
           multibyte sequence starting at _s_ , if a non-null wide character
           was recognized.  It returns 0, if a null wide character was
           recognized.  It returns _(size_t) -1_ and sets _errno_ to EILSEQ , if
           an invalid multibyte sequence was encountered.  It returns
           _(size_t) -2_ if it couldn't parse a complete multibyte character,
           meaning that _n_ should be increased.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of mbrlen () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of the
           current locale.

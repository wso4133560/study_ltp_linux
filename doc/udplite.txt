    UDPLITE(7)              Linux Programmer's Manual             UDPLITE(7)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           udplite - Lightweight User Datagram Protocol
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/socket.h>
    
           sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDPLITE);
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           This is an implementation of the Lightweight User Datagram
           Protocol (UDP-Lite), as described in RFC 3828.
    
           UDP-Lite is an extension of UDP (RFC 768) to support variable-
           length checksums.  This has advantages for some types of
           multimedia transport that may be able to make use of slightly
           damaged datagrams, rather than having them discarded by lower-
           layer protocols.
    
           The variable-length checksum coverage is set via a setsockopt(2)
           option.  If this option is not set, the only difference from UDP
           is in using a different IP protocol identifier (IANA number 136).
    
           The UDP-Lite implementation is a full extension of udp(7)â€”that
           is, it shares the same API and API behavior, and in addition
           offers two socket options to control the checksum coverage.
    
       Address format
           UDP-Litev4 uses the _sockaddr_in_ address format described in
           ip(7).  UDP-Litev6 uses the _sockaddr_in6_ address format described
           in ipv6(7).
    
       Socket options
           To set or get a UDP-Lite socket option, call getsockopt(2) to
           read or setsockopt(2) to write the option with the option level
           argument set to IPPROTO_UDPLITE.  In addition, all IPPROTO_UDP
           socket options are valid on a UDP-Lite socket.  See udp(7) for
           more information.
    
           The following two options are specific to UDP-Lite.
    
           UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV
                  This option sets the sender checksum coverage and takes an
                  _int_ as argument, with a checksum coverage value in the
                  range 0..2^16-1.
    
                  A value of 0 means that the entire datagram is always
                  covered.  Values from 1-7 are illegal (RFC 3828, 3.1) and
                  are rounded up to the minimum coverage of 8.
    
                  With regard to IPv6 jumbograms (RFC 2675), the UDP-Litev6
                  checksum coverage is limited to the first 2^16-1 octets,
                  as per RFC 3828, 3.5.  Higher values are therefore
                  silently truncated to 2^16-1.  If in doubt, the current
                  coverage value can always be queried using getsockopt(2).
    
           UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV
                  This is the receiver-side analogue and uses the same
                  argument format and value range as UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV.
                  This option is not required to enable traffic with partial
                  checksum coverage.  Its function is that of a traffic
                  filter: when enabled, it instructs the kernel to drop all
                  packets which have a coverage _less_ than the specified
                  coverage value.
    
                  When the value of UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV exceeds the actual
                  packet coverage, incoming packets are silently dropped,
                  but may generate a warning message in the system log.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           All errors documented for udp(7) may be returned.  UDP-Lite does
           not add further errors.
    
## FILES         top

## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           UDP-Litev4/v6 first appeared in Linux 2.6.20.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           Where glibc support is missing, the following definitions are
           needed:
    
               #define IPPROTO_UDPLITE     136
               #define UDPLITE_SEND_CSCOV  10
               #define UDPLITE_RECV_CSCOV  11

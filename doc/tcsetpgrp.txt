    TCGETPGRP(3)            Linux Programmer's Manual           TCGETPGRP(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           tcgetpgrp, tcsetpgrp - get and set terminal foreground process
           group
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           pid_t tcgetpgrp(int _fd_ );
           int tcsetpgrp(int _fd_ , pid_t _pgrp_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The function tcgetpgrp () returns the process group ID of the
           foreground process group on the terminal associated to _fd_ , which
           must be the controlling terminal of the calling process.
    
           The function tcsetpgrp () makes the process group with process
           group ID _pgrp_ the foreground process group on the terminal
           associated to _fd_ , which must be the controlling terminal of the
           calling process, and still be associated with its session.
           Moreover, _pgrp_ must be a (nonempty) process group belonging to
           the same session as the calling process.
    
           If tcsetpgrp () is called by a member of a background process
           group in its session, and the calling process is not blocking or
           ignoring SIGTTOU , a SIGTTOU signal is sent to all members of this
           background process group.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           When _fd_ refers to the controlling terminal of the calling
           process, the function tcgetpgrp () will return the foreground
           process group ID of that terminal if there is one, and some value
           larger than 1 that is not presently a process group ID otherwise.
           When _fd_ does not refer to the controlling terminal of the calling
           process, -1 is returned, and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
           When successful, tcsetpgrp () returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns
           -1, and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EBADF _fd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           EINVAL _pgrp_ has an unsupported value.
    
           ENOTTY The calling process does not have a controlling terminal,
                  or it has one but it is not described by _fd_ , or, for
                  tcsetpgrp (), this controlling terminal is no longer
                  associated with the session of the calling process.
    
           EPERM _pgrp_ has a supported value, but is not the process group
                  ID of a process in the same session as the calling
                  process.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           These functions are implemented via the TIOCGPGRP and TIOCSPGRP
           ioctls.
    
       History
           The ioctls appeared in 4.2BSD.  The functions are POSIX
           inventions.

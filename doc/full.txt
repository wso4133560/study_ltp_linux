## NAME         top
    
    
           full - always full device
    
## CONFIGURATION         top
    
    
           If your system does not have _/dev/full_ created already, it can be
           created with the following commands:
    
               mknod -m 666 /dev/full c 1 7
               chown root:root /dev/full
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The file _/dev/full_ has major device number 1 and minor device
           number 7.
    
           Writes to the _/dev/full_ device fail with an ENOSPC error.  This
           can be used to test how a program handles disk-full errors.
    
           Reads from the _/dev/full_ device will return \0 characters.
    
           Seeks on _/dev/full_ will always succeed.

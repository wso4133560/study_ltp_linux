    LISTEN(2)               Linux Programmer's Manual              LISTEN(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           listen - listen for connections on a socket
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/socket.h>
    
           int listen(int _sockfd_ , int _backlog_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           listen () marks the socket referred to by _sockfd_ as a passive
           socket, that is, as a socket that will be used to accept incoming
           connection requests using accept(2).
    
           The _sockfd_ argument is a file descriptor that refers to a socket
           of type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.
    
           The _backlog_ argument defines the maximum length to which the
           queue of pending connections for _sockfd_ may grow.  If a
           connection request arrives when the queue is full, the client may
           receive an error with an indication of ECONNREFUSED or, if the
           underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may be
           ignored so that a later reattempt at connection succeeds.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EADDRINUSE
                  Another socket is already listening on the same port.
    
           EADDRINUSE
                  (Internet domain sockets) The socket referred to by _sockfd_
                  had not previously been bound to an address and, upon
                  attempting to bind it to an ephemeral port, it was
                  determined that all port numbers in the ephemeral port
                  range are currently in use.  See the discussion of
                  _/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range_ in ip(7).
    
           EBADF The argument _sockfd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           ENOTSOCK
                  The file descriptor _sockfd_ does not refer to a socket.
    
           EOPNOTSUPP
                  The socket is not of a type that supports the listen ()
                  operation.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD ( listen () first appeared in
           4.2BSD).
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           To accept connections, the following steps are performed:
    
               1.  A socket is created with socket(2).
    
               2.  The socket is bound to a local address using bind(2), so
                   that other sockets may be connect(2)ed to it.
    
               3.  A willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue
                   limit for incoming connections are specified with
                   listen ().
    
               4.  Connections are accepted with accept(2).
    
           The behavior of the _backlog_ argument on TCP sockets changed with
           Linux 2.2.  Now it specifies the queue length for _completely_
           established sockets waiting to be accepted, instead of the number
           of incomplete connection requests.  The maximum length of the
           queue for incomplete sockets can be set using
           _/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog_.  When syncookies are
           enabled there is no logical maximum length and this setting is
           ignored.  See tcp(7) for more information.
    
           If the _backlog_ argument is greater than the value in
           _/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn_ , then it is silently truncated to
           that value.  Since Linux 5.4, the default in this file is 4096;
           in earlier kernels, the default value is 128.  In kernels before
           2.4.25, this limit was a hard coded value, SOMAXCONN , with the
           value 128.

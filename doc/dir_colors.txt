## NAME         top
    
    
           dir_colors - configuration file for dircolors(1)
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The program ls(1) uses the environment variable LS_COLORS to
           determine the colors in which the filenames are to be displayed.
           This environment variable is usually set by a command like
    
                  eval `dircolors some_path/dir_colors`
    
           found in a system default shell initialization file, like
           _/etc/profile_ or _/etc/csh.cshrc_.  (See also dircolors(1).)
           Usually, the file used here is _/etc/DIR_COLORS_ and can be
           overridden by a _.dir_colors_ file in one's home directory.
    
           This configuration file consists of several statements, one per
           line.  Anything right of a hash mark (#) is treated as a comment,
           if the hash mark is at the beginning of a line or is preceded by
           at least one whitespace.  Blank lines are ignored.
    
           The _global_ section of the file consists of any statement before
           the first TERM statement.  Any statement in the global section of
           the file is considered valid for all terminal types.  Following
           the global section is one or more _terminal-specific_ sections,
           preceded by one or more TERM statements which specify the
           terminal types (as given by the TERM environment variable) the
           following declarations apply to.  It is always possible to
           override a global declaration by a subsequent terminal-specific
           one.
    
           The following statements are recognized; case is insignificant:
    
           TERM _terminal-type_
                  Starts a terminal-specific section and specifies which
                  terminal it applies to.  Multiple TERM statements can be
                  used to create a section which applies for several
                  terminal types.
    
           COLOR yes|all|no|none|tty
                  (Slackware only; ignored by GNU dircolors(1).)  Specifies
                  that colorization should always be enabled ( _yes_ or _all_ ),
                  never enabled ( _no_ or _none_ ), or enabled only if the output
                  is a terminal ( _tty_ ).  The default is _no_.
    
           EIGHTBIT yes|no
                  (Slackware only; ignored by GNU dircolors(1).)  Specifies
                  that eight-bit ISO 8859 characters should be enabled by
                  default.  For compatibility reasons, this can also be
                  specified as 1 for _yes_ or 0 for _no_.  The default is _no_.
    
           OPTIONS _options_
                  (Slackware only; ignored by GNU dircolors(1).)  Adds
                  command-line options to the default ls command line.  The
                  options can be any valid ls command-line options, and
                  should include the leading minus sign.  Note that
                  dircolors does not verify the validity of these options.
    
           NORMAL _color-sequence_
                  Specifies the color used for normal (nonfilename) text.
    
                  Synonym: NORM.
    
           FILE _color-sequence_
                  Specifies the color used for a regular file.
    
           DIR _color-sequence_
                  Specifies the color used for directories.

           ORPHAN _color-sequence_
                  Specifies the color used for an orphaned symbolic link
                  (one which points to a nonexistent file).  If this is
                  unspecified, ls will use the LINK color instead.
    
           MISSING _color-sequence_
                  Specifies the color used for a missing file (a nonexistent
                  file which nevertheless has a symbolic link pointing to
                  it).  If this is unspecified, ls will use the FILE color
                  instead.
    
           FIFO _color-sequence_
                  Specifies the color used for a FIFO (named pipe).

                  with the executable attribute set.
    
                  Synonym: OWT.
    
           OTHER_WRITABLE _color-sequence_

            _extension color-sequence_
                  Specifies the color used for any file that ends in

            . _extension color-sequence_
                  Same as . _extension_.  Specifies the color used for any
                  file that ends in . _extension_.  Note that the period is
                  included in the extension, which makes it impossible to
                  specify an extension not starting with a period, such as ~
                  for emacs backup files.  This form should be considered
                  obsolete.
    
       ISO 6429 (ANSI) color sequences
           Most color-capable ASCII terminals today use ISO 6429 (ANSI)
           color sequences, and many common terminals without color
           capability, including xterm and the widely used and cloned DEC
           VT100, will recognize ISO 6429 color codes and harmlessly
           eliminate them from the output or emulate them.  ls uses ISO 6429
           codes by default, assuming colorization is enabled.
    
           ISO 6429 color sequences are composed of sequences of numbers
           separated by semicolons.  The most common codes are:
    
                   0   to restore default color
                   1   for brighter colors
                   4   for underlined text
                   5   for flashing text
                  30   for black foreground
                  31   for red foreground
                  32   for green foreground
                  33   for yellow (or brown) foreground
                  34   for blue foreground
                  35   for purple foreground
                  36   for cyan foreground
                  37   for white (or gray) foreground
                  40   for black background
                  41   for red background
                  42   for green background
                  43   for yellow (or brown) background
                  44   for blue background
    
                  45   for purple background
                  46   for cyan background
                  47   for white (or gray) background
    
           Not all commands will work on all systems or display devices.
    
           ls uses the following defaults:
    
           NORMAL 0           Normal (nonfilename) text
           FILE 0           Regular file
           DIR 32          Directory
           LINK 36          Symbolic link
           ORPHAN undefined   Orphaned symbolic link
           MISSING undefined   Missing file
           FIFO 31          Named pipe (FIFO)
           SOCK 33          Socket
           BLK 44;37       Block device
           CHR 44;37       Character device
           EXEC 35          Executable file
    
           A few terminal programs do not recognize the default properly.
           If all text gets colorized after you do a directory listing,
           change the NORMAL and FILE codes to the numerical codes for your
           normal foreground and background colors.
    
       Other terminal types (advanced configuration)
           If you have a color-capable (or otherwise highlighting) terminal
           (or printer!) which uses a different set of codes, you can still
           generate a suitable setup.  To do so, you will have to use the
           LEFTCODE , RIGHTCODE , and ENDCODE definitions.
    
           When writing out a filename, ls generates the following output
           sequence: LEFTCODE _typecode_ RIGHTCODE _filename_ ENDCODE , where the
           _typecode_ is the color sequence that depends on the type or name
           of file.  If the ENDCODE is undefined, the sequence LEFTCODE
           NORMAL RIGHTCODE will be used instead.  The purpose of the left-
           and rightcodes is merely to reduce the amount of typing necessary
           (and to hide ugly escape codes away from the user).  If they are
           not appropriate for your terminal, you can eliminate them by
           specifying the respective keyword on a line by itself.
    
           NOTE: If the ENDCODE is defined in the global section of the
           setup file, it _cannot_ be undefined in a terminal-specific section
           of the file.  This means any NORMAL definition will have no
           effect.  A different ENDCODE can, however, be specified, which
           would have the same effect.
    
       Escape sequences
           To specify control- or blank characters in the color sequences or
           filename extensions, either C-style \-escaped notation or
           stty -style ^-notation can be used.  The C-style notation includes
           the following characters:
    
                  \a Bell (ASCII 7)
                  \b Backspace (ASCII 8)
                  \e Escape (ASCII 27)
                  \f Form feed (ASCII 12)
                  \n Newline (ASCII 10)
                  \r Carriage Return (ASCII 13)
                  \t Tab (ASCII 9)
                  \v Vertical Tab (ASCII 11)
                  \? Delete (ASCII 127)
                  \ _nnn_    Any character (octal notation)
                  \x _nnn_   Any character (hexadecimal notation)
                  \_ Space
                  \\ Backslash (\)
                  \^ Caret (^)
    
                  \# Hash mark (#)
    
           Note that escapes are necessary to enter a space, backslash,
           caret, or any control character anywhere in the string, as well
           as a hash mark as the first character.

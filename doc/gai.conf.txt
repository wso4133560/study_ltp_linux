## NAME         top
    
    
           gai.conf - getaddrinfo(3) configuration file
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           A call to getaddrinfo(3) might return multiple answers.
           According to RFC 3484 these answers must be sorted so that the
           answer with the highest success rate is first in the list.  The
           RFC provides an algorithm for the sorting.  The static rules are
           not always adequate, though.  For this reason, the RFC also
           requires that system administrators should have the possibility
           to dynamically change the sorting.  For the glibc implementation,
           this can be achieved with the _/etc/gai.conf_ file.
    
           Each line in the configuration file consists of a keyword and its
           parameters.  White spaces in any place are ignored.  Lines
           starting with '#' are comments and are ignored.
    
           The keywords currently recognized are:
    
           label _netmask precedence_
                  The value is added to the label table used in the RFC 3484
                  sorting.  If any label definition is present in the
                  configuration file, the default table is not used.  All
                  the label definitions of the default table which are to be
                  maintained have to be duplicated.  Following the keyword,
                  the line has to contain a network mask and a precedence
                  value.
    
           precedence _netmask precedence_
                  This keyword is similar to label , but instead the value is
                  added to the precedence table as specified in RFC 3484.
                  Once again, the presence of a single precedence line in
                  the configuration file causes the default table to not be
                  used.
    
           reload < yes | no >
                  This keyword controls whether a process checks whether the
                  configuration file has been changed since the last time it
                  was read.  If the value is " yes ", the file is reread.
                  This might cause problems in multithreaded applications
                  and is generally a bad idea.  The default is " no ".
    
           scopev4 _mask value_
                  Add another rule to the RFC 3484 scope table for IPv4
                  address.  By default, the scope IDs described in section
                  3.2 in RFC 3438 are used.  Changing these defaults should
                  hardly ever be necessary.

           _/etc/gai.conf_
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The _gai.conf_ file is supported by glibc since version 2.5.
    
## EXAMPLES         top
    
    
           The default table according to RFC 3484 would be specified with
           the following configuration file:
    
               label  ::1/128       0
               label  ::/0          1
               label  2002::/16     2
               label ::/96          3
               label ::ffff:0:0/96  4
               precedence  ::1/128       50
               precedence  ::/0          40
               precedence  2002::/16     30
               precedence ::/96          20
               precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  10

       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           getpagesize ():
               Since glibc 2.20:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE || ! (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L)
               Glibc 2.12 to 2.19:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || ! (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L)
               Before glibc 2.12:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The function getpagesize () returns the number of bytes in a
           memory page, where "page" is a fixed-length block, the unit for
           memory allocation and file mapping performed by mmap(2).

           SVr4, 4.4BSD, SUSv2.  In SUSv2 the getpagesize () call is labeled
           LEGACY, and in POSIX.1-2001 it has been dropped; HP-UX does not
           have this call.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Portable applications should employ _sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)_ instead
           of getpagesize ():
    
               #include <unistd.h>
               long sz = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
    
           (Most systems allow the synonym _SC_PAGE_SIZE for _SC_PAGESIZE.)
    
           Whether getpagesize () is present as a Linux system call depends
           on the architecture.  If it is, it returns the kernel symbol
           PAGE_SIZE , whose value depends on the architecture and machine
           model.  Generally, one uses binaries that are dependent on the
           architecture but not on the machine model, in order to have a
           single binary distribution per architecture.  This means that a
           user program should not find PAGE_SIZE at compile time from a
           header file, but use an actual system call, at least for those
           architectures (like sun4) where this dependency exists.  Here
           glibc 2.0 fails because its getpagesize () returns a statically
           derived value, and does not use a system call.  Things are OK in
           glibc 2.1.

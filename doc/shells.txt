## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           _/etc/shells_ is a text file which contains the full pathnames of
           valid login shells.  This file is consulted by chsh(1) and
           available to be queried by other programs.
    
           Be aware that there are programs which consult this file to find
           out if a user is a normal user; for example, FTP daemons
           traditionally disallow access to users with shells not included
           in this file.

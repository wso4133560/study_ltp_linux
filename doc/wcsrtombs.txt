## NAME         top
    
    
           wcsrtombs - convert a wide-character string to a multibyte string
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           size_t wcsrtombs(char restrict _dest_ , const wchar_t restrict _src_ ,
                            size_t _len_ , mbstate_t restrict _ps_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           If _dest_ is not NULL, the wcsrtombs () function converts the wide-
           character string _src_ to a multibyte string starting at _dest_.  At
           most _len_ bytes are written to _dest_.  The shift state _ps_ is
           updated.  The conversion is effectively performed by repeatedly
           calling _wcrtomb(dest, src, ps)_ , as long as this call succeeds,
           and then incrementing _dest_ by the number of bytes written and
           _src_ by one.  The conversion can stop for three reasons:
    
           1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be
              represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the current
              locale).  In this case, _src_ is left pointing to the invalid
              wide character, _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and _errno_ is set to
              EILSEQ.
    
           2. The length limit forces a stop.  In this case, _src_ is left
              pointing to the next wide character to be converted, and the
              number of bytes written to _dest_ is returned.
    
           3. The wide-character string has been completely converted,
              including the terminating null wide character (L'\0'), which
              has the side effect of bringing back _ps_ to the initial state.
              In this case, _src_ is set to NULL, and the number of bytes
              written to _dest_ , excluding the terminating null byte ('\0'),
              is returned.
    
           If _dest_ is NULL, _len_ is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as
           above, except that the converted bytes are not written out to
           memory, and that no length limit exists.
    
           In both of the above cases, if _ps_ is NULL, a static anonymous
           state known only to the wcsrtombs () function is used instead.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _len_
           bytes at _dest_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The wcsrtombs () function returns the number of bytes that make up
           the converted part of multibyte sequence, not including the
           terminating null byte.  If a wide character was encountered which
           could not be converted, _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and _errno_ set to
           EILSEQ.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of wcsrtombs () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.
    
           Passing NULL as _ps_ is not multithread safe.

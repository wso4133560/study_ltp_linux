       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           uselocale ():
               Since glibc 2.10:
                   _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700
               Before glibc 2.10:

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The uselocale () function sets the current locale for the calling
           thread, and returns the thread's previously current locale.
           After a successful call to uselocale (), any calls by this thread
           to functions that depend on the locale will operate as though the
           locale has been set to _newloc_.
    
           The _newloc_ argument can have one of the following values:
    
           A handle returned by a call to newlocale(3) or duplocale(3)
                  The calling thread's current locale is set to the
                  specified locale.
    
           The special locale object handle LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
                  The calling thread's current locale is set to the global
                  locale determined by setlocale(3).
    
           _(locale_t) 0_
                  The calling thread's current locale is left unchanged (and
                  the current locale is returned as the function result).
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, uselocale () returns the locale handle that was set by
           the previous call to uselocale () in this thread, or
           LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE if there was no such previous call.  On error,
           it returns _(locale_t) 0_ , and sets _errno_ to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL _newloc_ does not refer to a valid locale object.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           The uselocale () function first appeared in version 2.3 of the GNU
           C library.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2008.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Unlike setlocale(3), uselocale () does not allow selective
           replacement of individual locale categories.  To employ a locale
           that differs in only a few categories from the current locale,
           use calls to duplocale(3) and newlocale(3) to obtain a locale
           object equivalent to the current locale and modify the desired
           categories in that object.

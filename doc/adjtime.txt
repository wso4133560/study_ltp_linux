    ADJTIME(3)              Linux Programmer's Manual             ADJTIME(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           adjtime - correct the time to synchronize the system clock
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/time.h>
    
           int adjtime(const struct timeval  _delta_ , struct timeval  _olddelta_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           adjtime ():
               Since glibc 2.19:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               Glibc 2.19 and earlier:
                   _BSD_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The adjtime () function gradually adjusts the system clock (as
           returned by gettimeofday(2)).  The amount of time by which the
           clock is to be adjusted is specified in the structure pointed to
           by _delta_.  This structure has the following form:
    
               struct timeval {
                   time_t      tv_sec;     / seconds /
                   suseconds_t tv_usec;    / microseconds /
               };
    
           If the adjustment in _delta_ is positive, then the system clock is
           speeded up by some small percentage (i.e., by adding a small
           amount of time to the clock value in each second) until the
           adjustment has been completed.  If the adjustment in _delta_ is
           negative, then the clock is slowed down in a similar fashion.
    
           If a clock adjustment from an earlier adjtime () call is already
           in progress at the time of a later adjtime () call, and _delta_ is
           not NULL for the later call, then the earlier adjustment is
           stopped, but any already completed part of that adjustment is not
           undone.
    
           If _olddelta_ is not NULL, then the buffer that it points to is
           used to return the amount of time remaining from any previous
           adjustment that has not yet been completed.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, adjtime () returns 0.  On failure, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EINVAL The adjustment in _delta_ is outside the permitted range.
    
           EPERM The caller does not have sufficient privilege to adjust
                  the time.  Under Linux, the CAP_SYS_TIME capability is
                  required.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           4.3BSD, System V.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The adjustment that adjtime () makes to the clock is carried out
           in such a manner that the clock is always monotonically
           increasing.  Using adjtime () to adjust the time prevents the
           problems that can be caused for certain applications (e.g.,
           make(1)) by abrupt positive or negative jumps in the system time.
    
           adjtime () is intended to be used to make small adjustments to the
           system time.  Most systems impose a limit on the adjustment that
           can be specified in _delta_.  In the glibc implementation, _delta_
           must be less than or equal to (INT_MAX / 1000000 - 2) and greater
           than or equal to (INT_MIN / 1000000 + 2) (respectively 2145 and
           -2145 seconds on i386).
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           A longstanding bug meant that if _delta_ was specified as NULL, no
           valid information about the outstanding clock adjustment was
           returned in _olddelta_.  (In this circumstance, adjtime () should
           return the outstanding clock adjustment, without changing it.)
           This bug is fixed on systems with glibc 2.8 or later and Linux
           kernel 2.6.26 or later.

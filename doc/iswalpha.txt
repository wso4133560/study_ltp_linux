## NAME         top
    
    
           iswalpha - test for alphabetic wide character
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wctype.h>
    
           int iswalpha(wint_t _wc_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The iswalpha () function is the wide-character equivalent of the
           isalpha(3) function.  It tests whether _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "alpha".
    
           The wide-character class "alpha" is a subclass of the wide-
           character class "alnum", and therefore also a subclass of the
           wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-character class
           "print".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
           character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "cntrl".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
           character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "space" and its subclass "blank".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-
           character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "punct".
    
           The wide-character class "alpha" is disjoint from the wide-
           character class "digit".
    
           The wide-character class "alpha" contains the wide-character
           classes "upper" and "lower".
    
           The wide-character class "alpha" always contains at least the
           letters 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z'.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The iswalpha () function returns nonzero if _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "alpha".  Otherwise, it
           returns zero.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of iswalpha () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.

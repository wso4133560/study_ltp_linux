    S390_STHYI(2)              System Calls Manual             S390_STHYI(2)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           s390_sthyi - emulate STHYI instruction
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <asm/unistd.h>
    
           int s390_sthyi(unsigned long _function_code_ , void  _resp_buffer_ ,
                          uint64_t  _return_code_ , unsigned long _flags_ );
    
           _Note_ : There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The s390_sthyi () system call emulates the STHYI (Store Hypervisor
           Information) instruction.  It provides hardware resource
           information for the machine and its virtualization levels.  This
           includes CPU type and capacity, as well as the machine model and
           other metrics.
    
           The _function_code_ argument indicates which function to perform.
           The following code(s) are supported:
    
           0      Return CP (Central Processor) and IFL (Integrated Facility
                  for Linux) capacity information.
    
           The _resp_buffer_ argument specifies the address of a response
           buffer.  When the _function_code_ is 0, the buffer must be one page
           (4K) in size.  If the system call returns 0, the response buffer
           will be filled with CPU capacity information.  Otherwise, the
           response buffer's content is unchanged.
    
           The _return_code_ argument stores the return code of the STHYI
           instruction, using one of the following values:
    
           0      Success.
    
           4      Unsupported function code.
    
           For further details about _return_code_ , _function_code_ , and
           _resp_buffer_ , see the reference given in NOTES.
    
           The _flags_ argument is provided to allow for future extensions and
           currently must be set to 0.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success (that is: emulation succeeded), the return value of
           s390_sthyi () matches the condition code of the STHYI
           instructions, which is a value in the range [0..3].  A return
           value of 0 indicates that CPU capacity information is stored in
           _resp_buffer_.  A return value of 3 indicates "unsupported
           function code" and the content of _resp_buffer_ is unchanged.  The
           return values 1 and 2 are reserved.
    
           On error, -1 is returned, and _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EFAULT The value specified in _resp_buffer_ or _return_code_ is not a
                  valid address.
    
           EINVAL The value specified in _flags_ is nonzero.
    
           ENOMEM Allocating memory for handling the CPU capacity
                  information failed.
    
           EOPNOTSUPP
                  The value specified in _function_code_ is not valid.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           This system call is available since Linux 4.15.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This Linux-specific system call is available only on the s390
           architecture.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call; call it
           using syscall(2)
    
           For details of the STHYI instruction, see the documentation page
           
           ⟨https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.3.0/com.ibm.zvm.v630.hcpb4/hcpb4sth.htm⟩.
    
           When the system call interface is used, the response buffer
           doesn't have to fulfill alignment requirements described in the
           STHYI instruction definition.
    
           The kernel caches the response (for up to one second, as of Linux
           4.16).  Subsequent system call invocations may return the cached
           response.

    FTIME(3)                Linux Programmer's Manual               FTIME(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           ftime - return date and time
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/timeb.h>
    
           int ftime(struct timeb  _tp_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           NOTE : This function is no longer provided by the GNU C library.
           Use clock_gettime(2) instead.
    
           This function returns the current time as seconds and
           milliseconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
           The time is returned in _tp_ , which is declared as follows:
    
               struct timeb {
                   time_t         time;
                   unsigned short millitm;
                   short          timezone;
                   short          dstflag;
               };
    
           Here _time_ is the number of seconds since the Epoch, and _millitm_
           is the number of milliseconds since _time_ seconds since the Epoch.
           The _timezone_ field is the local timezone measured in minutes of
           time west of Greenwich (with a negative value indicating minutes
           east of Greenwich).  The _dstflag_ field is a flag that, if
           nonzero, indicates that Daylight Saving time applies locally
           during the appropriate part of the year.
    
           POSIX.1-2001 says that the contents of the _timezone_ and _dstflag_
           fields are unspecified; avoid relying on them.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           This function always returns 0.  (POSIX.1-2001 specifies, and
           some systems document, a -1 error return.)
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           Starting with glibc 2.33, the ftime () function and the
           _< sys/timeb.h>_ header have been removed.  To support old binaries,
           glibc continues to provide a compatibility symbol for
           applications linked against glibc 2.32 and earlier.
    
## ATTRIBUTES         top

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           4.2BSD, POSIX.1-2001.  POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of
           ftime ().
    
           This function is obsolete.  Don't use it.  If the time in seconds
           suffices, time(2) can be used; gettimeofday(2) gives
           microseconds; clock_gettime(2) gives nanoseconds but is not as
           widely available.
    
## BUGS         top
    
    
           Early glibc2 is buggy and returns 0 in the _millitm_ field; glibc
           2.1.1 is correct again.

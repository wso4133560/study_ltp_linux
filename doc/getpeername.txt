## NAME         top
    
    
           getpeername - get name of connected peer socket
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/socket.h>
    
           int getpeername(int _sockfd_ , struct sockaddr restrict _addr_ ,
                           socklen_t restrict _addrlen_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           getpeername () returns the address of the peer connected to the
           socket _sockfd_ , in the buffer pointed to by _addr_.  The _addrlen_
           argument should be initialized to indicate the amount of space
           pointed to by _addr_.  On return it contains the actual size of the
           name returned (in bytes).  The name is truncated if the buffer
           provided is too small.
    
           The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too
           small; in this case, _addrlen_ will return a value greater than was
           supplied to the call.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EBADF The argument _sockfd_ is not a valid file descriptor.
    
           EFAULT The _addr_ argument points to memory not in a valid part of
                  the process address space.
    
           EINVAL _addrlen_ is invalid (e.g., is negative).
    
           ENOBUFS
                  Insufficient resources were available in the system to
                  perform the operation.
    
           ENOTCONN
                  The socket is not connected.
    
           ENOTSOCK
                  The file descriptor _sockfd_ does not refer to a socket.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.4BSD ( getpeername () first
           appeared in 4.2BSD).
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           For background on the _socklen_t_ type, see accept(2).
    
           For stream sockets, once a connect(2) has been performed, either
           socket can call getpeername () to obtain the address of the peer
           socket.  On the other hand, datagram sockets are connectionless.
           Calling connect(2) on a datagram socket merely sets the peer
           address for outgoing datagrams sent with write(2) or recv(2).
           The caller of connect(2) can use getpeername () to obtain the peer
           address that it earlier set for the socket.  However, the peer
           socket is unaware of this information, and calling getpeername ()
           on the peer socket will return no useful information (unless a
           connect(2) call was also executed on the peer).  Note also that
           the receiver of a datagram can obtain the address of the sender
           when using recvfrom(2).

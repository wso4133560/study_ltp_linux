## NAME         top
    
    
           MB_LEN_MAX - maximum multibyte length of a character across all
           locales
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <limits.h>
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The MB_LEN_MAX macro is the maximum number of bytes needed to
           represent a single wide character, in any of the supported
           locales.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           A constant integer greater than zero.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C99.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The entities MB_LEN_MAX and _sizeof(wchar_t)_ are totally
           unrelated.  In glibc, MB_LEN_MAX is typically 16 (6 in glibc
           versions earlier than 2.2), while _sizeof(wchar_t)_ is 4.

## NAME         top
    
    
           fwide - set and determine the orientation of a FILE stream
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wchar.h>
    
           int fwide(FILE  _stream_ , int _mode_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           fwide ():
               _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _ISOC99_SOURCE
                   || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           When _mode_ is zero, the fwide () function determines the current
           orientation of _stream_.  It returns a positive value if _stream_ is
           wide-character oriented, that is, if wide-character I/O is
           permitted but char I/O is disallowed.  It returns a negative
           value if _stream_ is byte orientedâ€”that is, if char I/O is
           permitted but wide-character I/O is disallowed.  It returns zero
           if _stream_ has no orientation yet; in this case the next I/O
           operation might change the orientation (to byte oriented if it is
           a char I/O operation, or to wide-character oriented if it is a
           wide-character I/O operation).
    
           Once a stream has an orientation, it cannot be changed and
           persists until the stream is closed.
    
           When _mode_ is nonzero, the fwide () function first attempts to set
           _stream_ 's orientation (to wide-character oriented if _mode_ is
           greater than 0, or to byte oriented if _mode_ is less than 0).  It
           then returns a value denoting the current orientation, as above.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The fwide () function returns the stream's orientation, after
           possibly changing it.  A positive return value means wide-
           character oriented.  A negative return value means byte oriented.
           A return value of zero means undecided.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           Wide-character output to a byte oriented stream can be performed
           through the fprintf(3) function with the %lc and %ls directives.
    
           Char oriented output to a wide-character oriented stream can be
           performed through the fwprintf(3) function with the %c and %s
           directives.

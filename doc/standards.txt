## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The CONFORMING TO section that appears in many manual pages
           identifies various standards to which the documented interface
           conforms.  The following list briefly describes these standards.
    
           V7 Version 7 (also known as Seventh Edition) UNIX, released
                  by AT&T/Bell Labs in 1979.  After this point, UNIX systems
                  diverged into two main dialects: BSD and System V.
    
           4.2BSD This is an implementation standard defined by the 4.2
                  release of the _Berkeley Software Distribution_ , released by
                  the University of California at Berkeley.  This was the
                  first Berkeley release that contained a TCP/IP stack and
                  the sockets API.  4.2BSD was released in 1983.
    
                  Earlier major BSD releases included _3BSD_ (1980), _4BSD_
                  (1980), and _4.1BSD_ (1981).
    
           4.3BSD The successor to 4.2BSD, released in 1986.
    
           4.4BSD The successor to 4.3BSD, released in 1993.  This was the
                  last major Berkeley release.
    
           System V
                  This is an implementation standard defined by AT&T's
                  milestone 1983 release of its commercial System V (five)
                  release.  The previous major AT&T release was _System III_ ,
                  released in 1981.
    
           System V release 2 (SVr2)
                  This was the next System V release, made in 1985.  The
                  SVr2 was formally described in the _System V Interface_
                  _Definition version 1_ ( _SVID 1_ ) published in 1985.
    
           System V release 3 (SVr3)
                  This was the successor to SVr2, released in 1986.  This
                  release was formally described in the _System V Interface_
                  _Definition version 2_ ( _SVID 2_ ).
    
           System V release 4 (SVr4)
                  This was the successor to SVr3, released in 1989.  This
                  version of System V is described in the "Programmer's
                  Reference Manual: Operating System API (Intel processors)"
                  (Prentice-Hall 1992, ISBN 0-13-951294-2) This release was
                  formally described in the _System V Interface Definition_
                  _version 3_ ( _SVID 3_ ), and is considered the definitive
                  System V release.
    
           SVID 4 System V Interface Definition version 4, issued in 1995.

           C89 This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI
                  (American National Standards Institute) in 1989
                  ( _X3.159-1989_ ).  Sometimes this is known as _ANSI C_ , but
                  since C99 is also an ANSI standard, this term is
                  ambiguous.  This standard was also ratified by ISO
                  (International Standards Organization) in 1990 ( _ISO/IEC_
                  _9899:1990_ ), and is thus occasionally referred to as _ISO_
                  _C90_.
    
           C99 This revision of the C language standard was ratified by
                  ISO in 1999 ( _ISO/IEC 9899:1999_ ).  Available online at 
                  ⟨http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards⟩.
    
           C11 This revision of the C language standard was ratified by
                  ISO in 2011 ( _ISO/IEC 9899:2011_ ).
    
                  LFS The Large File Summit specification, completed in
                  1996.  This specification defined mechanisms that allowed
                  32-bit systems to support the use of large files (i.e.,
                  64-bit file offsets).  See 
                  ⟨https://www.opengroup.org/platform/lfs.html⟩.
    
           POSIX.1-1988
                  This was the first POSIX standard, ratified by IEEE as
                  IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, and subsequently adopted (with minor
                  revisions) as an ISO standard in 1990.  The term "POSIX"
                  was coined by Richard Stallman.
    
           POSIX.1-1990
                  "Portable Operating System Interface for Computing
                  Environments".  IEEE 1003.1-1990 part 1, ratified by ISO
                  in 1990 ( _ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990_ ).
    
           POSIX.2
                  IEEE Std 1003.2-1992, describing commands and utilities,
                  ratified by ISO in 1993 ( _ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993_ ).
    
           POSIX.1b (formerly known as _POSIX.4_ )
                  IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993, describing real-time facilities for
                  portable operating systems, ratified by ISO in 1996
                  ( _ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996_ ).
    
           POSIX.1c  (formerly known as _POSIX.4a_ )
                  IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995, which describes the POSIX threads
                  interfaces.
    
           POSIX.1d
                  IEEE Std 1003.1c-1999, which describes additional real-
                  time extensions.
    
           POSIX.1g
                  IEEE Std 1003.1g-2000, which describes networking APIs
                  (including sockets).
    
           POSIX.1j
                  IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000, which describes advanced real-time
                  extensions.
    
           POSIX.1-1996
                  A 1996 revision of POSIX.1 which incorporated POSIX.1b and
                  POSIX.1c.
    
           XPG3 Released in 1989, this was the first release of the X/Open
                  Portability Guide to be based on a POSIX standard
                  (POSIX.1-1988).  This multivolume guide was developed by
                  the X/Open Group, a multivendor consortium.
    
           XPG4 A revision of the X/Open Portability Guide, released in
                  1992.  This revision incorporated POSIX.2.
    
           XPG4v2 A 1994 revision of XPG4.  This is also referred to as _Spec_
                  _1170_ , where 1170 referred to the number of interfaces
                  defined by this standard.
    
           SUS (SUSv1)
                  Single UNIX Specification.  This was a repackaging of
                  XPG4v2 and other X/Open standards (X/Open Curses Issue 4
                  version 2, X/Open Networking Service (XNS) Issue 4).
                  Systems conforming to this standard can be branded _UNIX_
                  _95_.
    
           SUSv2 Single UNIX Specification version 2.  Sometimes also
                  referred to (incorrectly) as _XPG5_.  This standard appeared
                  in 1997.  Systems conforming to this standard can be
                  branded _UNIX 98_.  See also 
                  ⟨http://www.unix.org/version2/⟩.)
    
           POSIX.1-2001, SUSv3
                  This was a 2001 revision and consolidation of the POSIX.1,
                  POSIX.2, and SUS standards into a single document,
                  conducted under the auspices of the Austin Group 
                  ⟨http://www.opengroup.org/austin/⟩.  The standard is
                  available online at ⟨http://www.unix.org/version3/⟩.
    
                  The standard defines two levels of conformance: _POSIX_
                  _conformance_ , which is a baseline set of interfaces
                  required of a conforming system; and _XSI Conformance_ ,
                  which additionally mandates a set of interfaces (the "XSI
                  extension") which are only optional for POSIX conformance.
                  XSI-conformant systems can be branded _UNIX 03_.
    
                  The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:
    
                  XBD : Definitions, terms, and concepts, header file
                  specifications.
    
                  XSH : Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and
                  library functions in actual implementations).
    
                  XCU : Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the
                  area formerly described by POSIX.2).
    
                  XRAT : Informative text on the other parts of the standard.
    
                  POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the
                  library functions standardized in C99 are also
                  standardized in POSIX.1-2001.
    
                  The Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3) comprises
                  the Base Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT
                  as above, plus X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2 as an extra
                  volume that is not in POSIX.1-2001.
    
                  Two Technical Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements) of
                  the original 2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in 2003 and
                  TC2 in 2004.
    
           POSIX.1-2008, SUSv4
                  Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and
                  ratified in 2008.  The standard is available online at 
                  ⟨http://www.unix.org/version4/⟩.
    
                  The changes in this revision are not as large as those
                  that occurred for POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new
                  interfaces are added and various details of existing
                  specifications are modified.  Many of the interfaces that
                  were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008
                  revision of the standard.  A few interfaces that are
                  present in POSIX.1-2001 are marked as obsolete in
                  POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard altogether.
    
                  The revised standard is structured in the same way as its
                  predecessor.  The Single UNIX Specification version 4
                  (SUSv4) comprises the Base Specifications containing XBD,
                  XSH, XCU, and XRAT, plus X/Open Curses Issue 7 as an extra
                  volume that is not in POSIX.1-2008.
    
                  Again there are two levels of conformance: the baseline
                  _POSIX Conformance_ , and _XSI Conformance_ , which mandates an
                  additional set of interfaces beyond those in the base
                  specification.
    
                  In general, where the CONFORMING TO section of a manual
                  page lists POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the
                  interface also conforms to POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise
                  noted.
    
                  Technical Corrigendum 1 (minor fixes and improvements) of
                  this standard was released in 2013.
    
                  Technical Corrigendum 2 of this standard was released in
                  2016.
    
                  Further information can be found on the Austin Group web
                  site, ⟨http://www.opengroup.org/austin/⟩.
    
           SUSv4 2016 edition
                  This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2008, with the addition of
                  Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 and the XCurses
                  specification.
    
           POSIX.1-2017
                  This revision of POSIX is technically identical to
                  POSIX.1-2008 with Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 applied.
    
           SUSv4 2018 edition
                  This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2017, with the addition of
                  the XCurses specification.
    
           The interfaces documented in POSIX.1/SUS are available as manual
           pages under sections 0p (header files), 1p (commands), and 3p
           (functions); thus one can write "man 3p open".

## NAME         top
    
    
           vhangup - virtually hangup the current terminal
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <unistd.h>
    
           int vhangup(void);
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           vhangup ():
               Since glibc 2.21:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE
               In glibc 2.19 and 2.20:
                   _DEFAULT_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
               Up to and including glibc 2.19:
                   _BSD_SOURCE || (_XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE < 500)
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           vhangup () simulates a hangup on the current terminal.  This call
           arranges for other users to have a “clean” terminal at login
           time.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
           _errno_ is set to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EPERM The calling process has insufficient privilege to call
                  vhangup (); the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability is required.
    
## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           This call is Linux-specific, and should not be used in programs
           intended to be portable.

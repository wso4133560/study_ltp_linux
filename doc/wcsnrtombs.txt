## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The wcsnrtombs () function is like the wcsrtombs(3) function,
           except that the number of wide characters to be converted,
           starting at _src_ , is limited to _nwc_.
    
           If _dest_ is not NULL, the wcsnrtombs () function converts at most
           _nwc_ wide characters from the wide-character string _src_ to a
           multibyte string starting at _dest_.  At most _len_ bytes are written
           to _dest_.  The shift state _ps_ is updated.  The conversion is
           effectively performed by repeatedly calling _wcrtomb(dest, src,_
           _ps)_ , as long as this call succeeds, and then incrementing _dest_ by
           the number of bytes written and _src_ by one.  The conversion can
           stop for three reasons:
    
           1. A wide character has been encountered that can not be
              represented as a multibyte sequence (according to the current
              locale).  In this case, _src_ is left pointing to the invalid
              wide character, _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and _errno_ is set to
              EILSEQ.
    
           2. _nwc_ wide characters have been converted without encountering a
              null wide character (L'\0'), or the length limit forces a
              stop.  In this case, _src_ is left pointing to the next wide
              character to be converted, and the number of bytes written to
              _dest_ is returned.
    
           3. The wide-character string has been completely converted,
              including the terminating null wide character (which has the
              side effect of bringing back _ps_ to the initial state).  In
              this case, _src_ is set to NULL, and the number of bytes
              written to _dest_ , excluding the terminating null byte ('\0'),
              is returned.
    
           If _dest_ is NULL, _len_ is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as
           above, except that the converted bytes are not written out to
           memory, and that no destination length limit exists.
    
           In both of the above cases, if _ps_ is NULL, a static anonymous
           state known only to the wcsnrtombs () function is used instead.
    
           The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least _len_
           bytes at _dest_.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The wcsnrtombs () function returns the number of bytes that make
           up the converted part of multibyte sequence, not including the
           terminating null byte.  If a wide character was encountered which
           could not be converted, _(size_t) -1_ is returned, and _errno_ set to
           EILSEQ.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           POSIX.1-2008.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of wcsnrtombs () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.
    
           Passing NULL as _ps_ is not multithread safe.

## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The tzselect program asks the user for information about the
           current location, and outputs the resulting timezone description
           to standard output.  The output is suitable as a value for the TZ
           environment variable.
    
           All interaction with the user is done via standard input and
           standard error.
    
## EXIT STATUS         top
    
    
           The exit status is zero if a timezone was successfully obtained
           from the user, and is nonzero otherwise.

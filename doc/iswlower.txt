    ISWLOWER(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            ISWLOWER(3)
    
## NAME         top
    
    
           iswlower - test for lowercase wide character
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <wctype.h>
    
           int iswlower(wint_t _wc_ );
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The iswlower () function is the wide-character equivalent of the
           islower(3) function.  It tests whether _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "lower".
    
           The wide-character class "lower" is a subclass of the wide-
           character class "alpha", and therefore also a subclass of the
           wide-character class "alnum", of the wide-character class "graph"
           and of the wide-character class "print".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
           character class "lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "cntrl".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
           character class "lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "space" and its subclass "blank".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-
           character class "lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "punct".
    
           Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", the wide-
           character class "lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class
           "digit".
    
           The wide-character class "lower" contains at least those
           characters _wc_ which are equal to _towlower(wc)_ and different from
           _towupper(wc)_.
    
           The wide-character class "lower" always contains at least the
           letters 'a' to 'z'.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The iswlower () function returns nonzero if _wc_ is a wide character
           belonging to the wide-character class "lower".  Otherwise, it
           returns zero.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           The behavior of iswlower () depends on the LC_CTYPE category of
           the current locale.
    
           This function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode
           characters, because Unicode knows about three cases: upper,
           lower, and title case.

## NAME         top
    
    
           opendir, fdopendir - open a directory
    
## SYNOPSIS         top
    
    
           #include <sys/types.h>
           #include <dirent.h>
    
           DIR opendir(const char  _name_ );
           DIR fdopendir(int _fd_ );
    
       Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
       feature_test_macros(7)):
    
           fdopendir ():
               Since glibc 2.10:
                   _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L
               Before glibc 2.10:
                   _GNU_SOURCE
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The opendir () function opens a directory stream corresponding to
           the directory _name_ , and returns a pointer to the directory
           stream.  The stream is positioned at the first entry in the
           directory.
    
           The fdopendir () function is like opendir (), but returns a
           directory stream for the directory referred to by the open file
           descriptor _fd_.  After a successful call to fdopendir (), _fd_ is
           used internally by the implementation, and should not otherwise
           be used by the application.
    
## RETURN VALUE         top
    
    
           The opendir () and fdopendir () functions return a pointer to the
           directory stream.  On error, NULL is returned, and _errno_ is set
           to indicate the error.
    
## ERRORS         top
    
    
           EACCES Permission denied.
    
           EBADF _fd_ is not a valid file descriptor opened for reading.
    
           EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file
                  descriptors has been reached.
    
           ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files
                  has been reached.
    
           ENOENT Directory does not exist, or _name_ is an empty string.
    
           ENOMEM Insufficient memory to complete the operation.
    
           ENOTDIR
                  _name_ is not a directory.
    
## VERSIONS         top
    
    
           fdopendir () is available in glibc since version 2.4.

## CONFORMING TO         top
    
    
           opendir () is present on SVr4, 4.3BSD, and specified in
           POSIX.1-2001.  fdopendir () is specified in POSIX.1-2008.
    
## NOTES         top
    
    
           Filename entries can be read from a directory stream using
           readdir(3).
    
           The underlying file descriptor of the directory stream can be
           obtained using dirfd(3).
    
           The opendir () function sets the close-on-exec flag for the file
           descriptor underlying the _DIR _.  The fdopendir () function leaves
           the setting of the close-on-exec flag unchanged for the file
           descriptor, _fd_.  POSIX.1-200x leaves it unspecified whether a
           successful call to fdopendir () will set the close-on-exec flag
           for the file descriptor, _fd_.

## NAME         top
    
    
           nsswitch.conf - Name Service Switch configuration file
    
## DESCRIPTION         top
    
    
           The Name Service Switch (NSS) configuration file,
           _/etc/nsswitch.conf_ , is used by the GNU C Library and certain
           other applications to determine the sources from which to obtain
           name-service information in a range of categories, and in what
           order.  Each category of information is identified by a database
           name.
    
           The file is plain ASCII text, with columns separated by spaces or
           tab characters.  The first column specifies the database name.
           The remaining columns describe the order of sources to query and
           a limited set of actions that can be performed by lookup result.
    
           The following databases are understood by the GNU C Library:
    
           aliases
                  Mail aliases, used by getaliasent(3) and related
                  functions.
    
           ethers Ethernet numbers.
    
           group Groups of users, used by getgrent(3) and related
                  functions.
    
           hosts Host names and numbers, used by gethostbyname(3) and
                  related functions.
    
           initgroups
                  Supplementary group access list, used by getgrouplist(3)
                  function.
    
           netgroup
                  Network-wide list of hosts and users, used for access
                  rules.  C libraries before glibc 2.1 supported netgroups
                  only over NIS.
    
           networks
                  Network names and numbers, used by getnetent(3) and
                  related functions.
    
           passwd User passwords, used by getpwent(3) and related functions.
    
           protocols
                  Network protocols, used by getprotoent(3) and related
                  functions.
    
           publickey
                  Public and secret keys for Secure_RPC used by NFS and
                  NIS+.
    
           rpc Remote procedure call names and numbers, used by
                  getrpcbyname(3) and related functions.
    
           services
                  Network services, used by getservent(3) and related
                  functions.
    
           shadow Shadow user passwords, used by getspnam(3) and related
                  functions.
    
           The GNU C Library ignores databases with unknown names.  Some
           applications use this to implement special handling for their own
           databases.  For example, sudo(8) consults the sudoers database.
    
           Here is an example _/etc/nsswitch.conf_ file:
    
               passwd:         compat
               group:          compat
               shadow:         compat
    
               hosts:          dns [!UNAVAIL=return] files
               networks:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
               ethers:         nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
               protocols:      nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
               rpc:            nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
               services:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
    
           The first column is the database name.  The remaining columns
           specify:
    
             One or more service specifications, for example, "files",
              "db", or "nis".  The order of the services on the line
              determines the order in which those services will be queried,
              in turn, until a result is found.
    
             Optional actions to perform if a particular result is obtained
              from the preceding service, for example, "[NOTFOUND=return]".
    
           The service specifications supported on your system depend on the
           presence of shared libraries, and are therefore extensible.
           Libraries called _/lib/libnss_SERVICE.so._ X will provide the named
           _SERVICE_.  On a standard installation, you can use "files", "db",
           "nis", and "nisplus".  For the hosts database, you can
           additionally specify "dns".  For the passwd , group , and shadow
           databases, you can additionally specify "compat" (see
           Compatibility mode below).  The version number X may be 1 for
           glibc 2.0, or 2 for glibc 2.1 and later.  On systems with
           additional libraries installed, you may have access to further
           services such as "hesiod", "ldap", "winbind", and "wins".
    
           An action may also be specified following a service
           specification.  The action modifies the behavior following a
           result obtained from the preceding data source.  Action items
           take the general form:
    
               [ _STATUS_ = _ACTION_ ]
               [! _STATUS_ = _ACTION_ ]
    
           where
    
               _STATUS_ => success | notfound | unavail | tryagain
               _ACTION_ => return | continue | merge
    
           The ! negates the test, matching all possible results except the
           one specified.  The case of the keywords is not significant.
    
           The _STATUS_ value is matched against the result of the lookup
           function called by the preceding service specification, and can
           be one of:
    
               success
                      No error occurred and the requested entry is returned.
                      The default action for this condition is "return".
    
               notfound
                      The lookup succeeded, but the requested entry was not
                      found.  The default action for this condition is
                      "continue".
    
               unavail
                      The service is permanently unavailable.  This can mean
                      either that the required file cannot be read, or, for
                      network services, that the server is not available or
                      does not allow queries.  The default action for this
                      condition is "continue".
    
               tryagain
                      The service is temporarily unavailable.  This could
                      mean a file is locked or a server currently cannot
                      accept more connections.  The default action for this
                      condition is "continue".
    
           The _ACTION_ value can be one of:
    
               return Return a result now.  Do not call any further lookup
                      functions.  However, for compatibility reasons, if
                      this is the selected action for the group database and
                      the notfound status, and the configuration file does
                      not contain the initgroups line, the next lookup
                      function is always called, without affecting the
                      search result.
    
               continue
                      Call the next lookup function.
    
               merge _[SUCCESS=merge]_ is used between two database entries.
                      When a group is located in the first of the two group
                      entries, processing will continue on to the next one.
                      If the group is also found in the next entry (and the
                      group name and GID are an exact match), the member
                      list of the second entry will be added to the group
                      object to be returned.  Available since glibc 2.24.
                      Note that merging will not be done for getgrent(3) nor
                      will duplicate members be pruned when they occur in
                      both entries being merged.
    
       Compatibility mode (compat)
           The NSS "compat" service is similar to "files" except that it
           additionally permits special entries in corresponding files for
           granting users or members of netgroups access to the system.  The
           following entries are valid in this mode:
    
               For passwd and shadow databases:
    
                   + _user_  Include the specified _user_ from the NIS
                          passwd/shadow map.
    
                   +@ _netgroup_
                          Include all users in the given _netgroup_.
    
                   - _user_  Exclude the specified _user_ from the NIS
                          passwd/shadow map.
    
                   -@ _netgroup_
                          Exclude all users in the given _netgroup_.
    
                   + Include every user, except previously excluded
                          ones, from the NIS passwd/shadow map.
    
               For group database:
    
                   + _group_ Include the specified _group_ from the NIS group
                          map.
    
                   - _group_ Exclude the specified _group_ from the NIS group
                          map.
    
                   + Include every group, except previously excluded
                          ones, from the NIS group map.
    
           By default, the source is "nis", but this may be overridden by
           specifying any NSS service except "compat" itself as the source
           for the pseudo-databases passwd_compat , group_compat , and
           shadow_compat.
    
## FILES         top
    
    
           A service named _SERVICE_ is implemented by a shared object library
           named _libnss_SERVICE.so._ X that resides in _/lib_.

## NOTES         top
    
    
           Within each process that uses nsswitch.conf , the entire file is
           read only once.  If the file is later changed, the process will
           continue using the old configuration.
    
           Traditionally, there was only a single source for service
           information, often in the form of a single configuration file
           (e.g., _/etc/passwd_ ).  However, as other name services, such as
           the Network Information Service (NIS) and the Domain Name Service
           (DNS), became popular, a method was needed that would be more
           flexible than fixed search orders coded into the C library.  The
           Name Service Switch mechanism, which was based on the mechanism
           used by Sun Microsystems in the Solaris 2 C library, introduced a
           cleaner solution to the problem.
